[Lenny Rachitsky]: Used to have about 10 people full-time. Now you have 1.2 humans, 20 agents.
(中文): 过去曾有大约10名全职员工。现在只有1.2个人类员工和20个智能代理。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: We have 10 desks that used to be go-to market people. They're all just labeled with our agents, Repli for Replit, Quali for Qualified, Arti for Artisan. Agent Force needs a nickname. Agents work all night and they work weekends and they work on Christmas. We're done with hiring humans in sales. We're done.
(中文): 我们有10张办公桌，过去是市场拓展人员的工位。现在这些桌子都贴上了我们智能代理的标签：Repli代表Replit，Quali代表Qualified，Arti代表Artisan。Agent Force也需要一个简称。这些代理不分昼夜地工作，周末无休，连圣诞节也在运转。我们已经停止在销售岗位招聘人类员工了。彻底结束了。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: The business is doing very similarly to what it was when you had 10 humans.
(中文): 该业务的运营状况与您拥有10名员工时非常相似。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: If I had two more great humans that wanted to join, don't get me wrong, I would hire them tomorrow, but I'm not going to hire someone that after their third month in the job doesn't know what SaaStr does. I just can't do that. AI is replacing the jobs people don't want to do today, and it is displacing the midpack and the mediocre.
(中文): 如果再有两位杰出的人才想要加入，别误会，我明天就会聘用他们，但我不会雇佣那些入职三个月后仍不清楚SaaStr是做什么的人。我实在无法接受这一点。人工智能正在取代那些人们今天不愿从事的工作，并且正在淘汰那些表现平平、能力一般的人。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: How do you see the future of the sales profession?
(中文): 您如何看待销售职业的未来？

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: We should have $250,000 a year SDRs, but they'd be like ... At Vercel, they'd be managing 10 agents, not 10 people. The classic SDR junior kid that is hired out of college to send emails, we don't need them. Folks that qualify leads coming in, the contact mes that we see, we have no need for them today. They should be extinct next year.
(中文): 我们每年应该有25万美元的销售开发代表预算，但他们应该更像是……在Vercel，他们管理的会是10个智能体，而非10个人。那种刚从大学毕业、只会发邮件的初级销售开发代表，我们并不需要。那些负责筛选潜在客户、处理我们所见联系信息的人员，如今对我们而言已无必要。明年他们就应该被淘汰。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Someone's listening to us like, "Oh man, my job is in trouble."
(中文): 有人正听着我们说话，心想：“天哪，我的工作要保不住了。”

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: If you can go do this, you're hyper-employable.
(中文): 如果你能做到这一点，你就极具就业竞争力。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Today, my guest is Jason Lemkin, founder and CEO of SaaStr, the world's largest community for B2B founders, and one of my absolute favorite sales and go-to market minds on the planet. Jason is not only deeply knowledgeable about everything sales, he's also extremely articulate and direct, and is also now personally going super deep on what AI can do for a sales org. He's transformed his own SaaStr sales team from around 10 SDRs and AEs to one full-time AE, a part-time chief of AI, named Amelia, and 20 AI agents. He is seeing the same performance from his AI team as he saw with his former human team, and he's just getting started. These are my favorite kinds of conversations because the guest is living in the future and comes here to show us what the future is like, where we're headed, and how we can get there ourselves, and also just how to avoid all the pitfalls that he had to deal with along the way. We cover all of the things that he has learned about where sales and go-to market is going in the AI age. He gives a bunch of advice for salespeople and the future of their careers, the future of the go-to market org, how to win as an AI startup right now, what tools he's finding most useful, what it took to shift a sales team, and so much more.

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Lucky to be a super fan and then, to get to join, right? It's terrific to be on the other side.
(中文): 幸运能成为一名超级粉丝，然后，得以加入，对吧？站在另一边感觉太棒了。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: So this is our second conversation. We did our last conversation a year and a half ago. I don't know if you know this, but it became a pretty legendary episode. It's something people continue to share and that conversation is around basically a deep dive into building your sales org. And a lot has changed for you and the world since then. Kauf AI, and what's happened is you've gone extremely deep on what AI enables for sales, for startups, for go-to market. And what I love about conversations like this is you're basically living in the future. And you're here to give us a glimpse of where things are heading and tell us how to avoid the wrong turns and just help us get there ourselves.
(中文): 这是我们第二次对话。距离上一次交谈已经过去一年半了。不知你是否了解，那期节目后来成为了一个颇具传奇色彩的经典对话。至今仍被广泛传播分享，那场对话本质上是对构建销售团队的深度探讨。自那时起，你和整个世界都发生了许多变化。考夫人工智能领域的发展，让你深入探索了人工智能为销售、初创企业及市场拓展带来的可能性。我特别欣赏这类对话的原因在于，你仿佛始终生活在未来。今天你来到这里，正是要为我们揭示未来的发展方向，指引我们避开弯路，帮助我们亲自抵达那个未来。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: That I think I can do.
(中文): 我想我能做到。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: To start.
(中文): 开始。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Yes.
(中文): 是的。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Help us understand just the business you run, this SaaStr.
(中文): 请帮助我们了解您所经营的业务，即SaaStr。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Yes.
(中文): 是的。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: What is it you sell? What is the business? What is it you do, Jason?
(中文): 你们卖什么？业务是什么？你们做什么，杰森？

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: I'm still trying to figure it out, Lenny. Maybe you are too in some ways.
(中文): 我还在努力想明白，莱尼。也许在某些方面你也是。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Yeah, that's true.
(中文): 是的，确实如此。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: So I am a two-time founder who started writing a blog, my God, in 2012 about all the mistakes I made after I sold my startup to Adobe. We started doing a couple meetups. You've done meetups. Before anyone did this stuff, we did a big meetup in 2015, thousands of people came. Then we do 10,000 people a year at SaaStr Annual. I've actually also invested almost 200 million dollars, almost 10X lifetime, only into founders from the community. But the reason I don't know is what I ... Folks that are connected to our content, I'm just passionate about helping other founders see mistakes and make less of them. So anyhow, we're a large community. I do invest, but it turned into a business. There was no revenue in the beginning. I'm sure there was no revenue, Lenny in the beginning. And ours was less intentional, but we do do eight figures of revenue a year and it's work. That sounds great to do eight figures, but there's a lot of costs, especially on the event side. The media side has almost no cost. And it's work. We have a hundred sponsors. And as you know ... You have sponsors, but there's a certain level where it becomes a lot of work. Getting two folks to sponsor your podcast with a couple emails, no work. If you wanted to have four Lenny podcast, it just scales. So we have built our own go-to market team over time, and I've lived the frustrations. Folks have followed it. And then, maybe I'm rambling a little bit. The interesting thing, the aha moment that happened to us is going into May of this year, we had one AI agent in production called Delphi that we both use for digital lending and Digital Jason. Really interesting learnings. And we went into our 10,000 person event this year with a seven-figure budget and eight-figure top line. And two folks on the sales team who were paid high end of market. I have many flaws, but paying well and being loyal are not one of them. And two of them just quit at the event. They just quit on site. And this is like the third time I've done this, like the eighth team I've built, and I turned to Amelia, our chief AI officer, and I said, "We're done with hiring humans in sales. We're done. We are going to push the limits with agents. We're going to put..." Even if it doesn't quite work. And I knew from this Delphi, this general agent that it would sort of work because going into annual, this general agent, this Digital Jason closed a 70K sponsorship on its own. So when I saw that a horizontal agent, not trained for sales, not trained for GTM could close one deal, they're like, "Let's deploy a couple of these apps. We have time. And I just can't pay a junior SDR $150,000 a year to quit. I just can't ... criticize me, but I just couldn't do it one more time. I just couldn't do it one more." And I actually think this isn't ... When I talk to CEOs at leading AI companies, they kind of don't want to do it either. They want to have the smallest sales teams they can as much for cultural reasons. Even if Replit only goes from zero to 200, it could have been 220 with the smaller sales team. I think I'm just okay with it. So it's an enduring theme. But anyhow, so we pushed the limits. And now if you walk into SaaStr's office, it's kind of funny. We have 10 desks that used to be go-to market people. They're all just labeled with our agents, Repli for Replit, Quali for Qualified, Arti for Artisan. Agentforce needs a nickname. Maybe we can make one up with Salesforce. There's Amelia's corner office at one end. I'm in the back of the office and it's just agents. It's the quietest office. And net-net, Lenny, it's about, here's the Meta learning for when we're recording this. The net productivity is about the same. It's not better, it's not worse, but it's so much more efficient and it scales because software scales. And we can talk about what we've learned. I think it's important that it takes time to train these agents. They don't work out of the box. But when you dial them in, when you take your best person or your best script and you train an agent with your best person and best script, that agent can start to become a version of your best salesperson, your best person. And that's what we've learned and how to perfect it. And I just think because ... and criticize me, you or anyone watching or listening, maybe it's not cool. I didn't want to hire my 28th rep that was going to quit, but I just couldn't do it one more time in the age of AI. I'm like, "It's time to go to the bleeding edge and just see what we can push the limits here."
(中文): 我是一位两次创业的创始人，从2012年开始写博客——天哪，那会儿我刚刚把自己的初创公司卖给Adobe，博客里全是我犯过的各种错误。后来我们组织了几场线下聚会。你也办过聚会。早在大家还没开始做这些的时候，我们在2015年办了一场大型聚会，来了几千人。现在我们每年举办的SaaStr年度大会能吸引上万人。实际上，我还投资了近2亿美元，整体回报接近10倍，而且只投给社区里的创业者。但我不太确定的是……对于那些关注我们内容的人，我只是真心想帮助其他创始人看清错误、少走弯路。总之，我们是个很大的社区。我确实做投资，但这逐渐发展成了一门生意。最初根本没有收入，我敢说Lenny你起步时也是零收入。我们起初也没刻意规划，但现在每年营收达到八位数，这背后需要付出很多努力。八位数听起来很棒，但成本也很高，尤其是活动方面。媒体业务几乎没什么成本。但这确实是项工作。我们有一百家赞助商。你也知道……你也有赞助商，但到了一定规模就会变得非常耗时。发几封邮件找两个人赞助你的播客不算什么，但如果想做成四个Lenny播客这样的规模，工作量就会指数级增长。所以我们逐步建立了自己的市场推广团队，我也亲身体会过其中的挫折。大家都关注着这个过程。也许我有点扯远了。有趣的是，我们今年五月遇到了一个“顿悟时刻”：当时我们有一个投入生产的AI助手叫Delphi，同时用于数字借贷和Digital Jason业务，收获了很多启发。今年我们举办万人大会时，预算七位数、营收八位数，销售团队有两位拿着行业顶尖薪水的人——我有很多缺点，但吝啬薪酬和缺乏忠诚不是其中两项。结果这两人居然在活动当场辞职了。这大概是我第三次经历这种事，也是我组建的第八个团队了。我转头对我们的首席AI官Amelia说：“我们再也不雇真人做销售了。到此为止。我们要用AI助手突破极限。哪怕效果不完美也要推行。”我从Delphi这个通用助手身上看到希望，因为就在年会前，这个Digital Jason助手独自谈成了一笔7万美元的赞助。当我发现一个未经销售培训、没有市场推广经验的通用助手能成交一单时，我就想：“部署几个这样的应用吧。我们还有时间。我实在无法再忍受每年花15万美元雇个初级销售开发代表然后看他辞职了。批评我也好，但我真的无法再来一次了。”而且我发现……当我与头部AI公司的CEO们交流时，他们其实也不愿扩大销售团队，更多是出于文化考量。即使Replit只能从0做到200，用小规模销售团队或许能做到220。我觉得这样也行。这成了我们坚持的方向。总之我们开始挑战极限。现在如果你走进SaaStr办公室会很有趣：原来市场团队的10个工位现在都贴着AI助手标签——Replit的Repli、Qualified的Quali、Artisan的Arti。Agentforce还需要个昵称，或许可以和Salesforce一起想一个。Amelia的角落办公室在一头，我在办公室最里面，现在全是AI助手在运作——这是最安静的办公室。总的来说Lenny，录这段时我想到的核心认知是：净生产力基本持平，没有更好也没有更差，但效率大幅提升且可扩展，因为软件本身具有扩展性。我们可以聊聊学到的经验：训练这些助手需要时间，它们不是开箱即用的。但当你精心调试，用最优秀的员工或最精妙的脚本来训练它们时，这些助手就能逐渐成为顶尖销售人员的复刻版。这就是我们的心得与优化方法。也许这样不够酷，你和观众听众们尽可以批评我——我只是不想再雇佣第28个会辞职的销售代表了。在AI时代，我无法再重复这样的循环。我觉得是时候冲向技术前沿，看看我们究竟能突破多少极限。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Okay. I love all the directions we're already heading. Okay. So just to help people totally understand what your business is, basically these people are selling sponsors for your conferences.
(中文): 好的。我非常喜欢我们目前的所有发展方向。那么，为了让人们完全理解您的业务，简单来说，这些人是在为您的会议销售赞助。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: They're selling two things because it's just relevant to the deep dive. They're selling sponsorships, which average about 70 to 80K. And then, they're also selling tickets, which is the high volume for ... This is like the self-serve version. They're selling tickets that are anywhere from a couple of hundred bucks to if you're a VC that comes the night before, could be two grand. No gifts for VCs that decide the night before. Founders that decide early get at about 20% of cost. And it's work to sell these tickets. And so, you can just post an email like you do and you probably fill up Lenny Summit, but if you want to max it out, you got to do work. You got to do drip campaigns. You got to reach out to people. You have to reactivate folks that came to Lenny's Summit three years ago, but you want them back because they're good people and that just requires work. And as your base scales, you have how many people subscribe to Lenny's newsletter now? 1.2 million or something.
(中文): 他们销售两种产品，因为这正好与深度剖析相关。他们销售赞助位，平均价格大约在7万到8万美元之间。此外，他们还销售门票，这是销量较大的部分……这就像是自助服务版本。他们销售的门票价格从几百美元到几千美元不等——如果你是风险投资人，前一天晚上才决定参加，票价可能高达两千美元。对于前一天才决定的风险投资人，没有赠品。而早期决定参加的创始人则可以享受大约20%的折扣。销售这些门票需要付出努力。所以，你可以像往常一样发一封邮件，或许就能填满Lenny峰会的位置，但如果你想最大化收益，就必须付出努力。你需要进行滴灌式营销活动，需要主动联系人们，需要重新激活三年前参加过Lenny峰会的人——你希望他们回来，因为他们是优秀的人才，而这都需要付出努力。随着你的基础规模扩大，现在有多少人订阅了Lenny的通讯？大约120万人吧。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: 1.2 million, roughly.
(中文): 大约120万。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Okay. How many of those is a human willing to reach out to? Approaching nons.
(中文): 好的。一个人愿意联系其中多少人？接近零个。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: 20,000. Yeah.
(中文): 两万。是的。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Imagine you hired a 21-year-old SDR fresh out of junior college and said, here's my list, 1.2 million people, start calling them. I want them to come to Lenny's Summit. But anyhow, so we have this low end version, which is tickets, which is four or five million a year. And then, we have this higher end sales cycle and they're very different and actually they have different agents. And then, we have a different agent to get people to come back, lapse people. So we have lapsed, high end and low end agents, and they have different workflows. And we actually use different vendors for now. For now, we use different vendors.
(中文): 假设你雇佣了一位刚从大专毕业的21岁销售开发代表，并告诉他：这是我的名单，120万人，开始给他们打电话。我希望他们来参加Lenny峰会。但不管怎样，我们有一个低端版本，就是门票销售，每年能带来四五百万的收入。然后，我们还有一个更高端的销售周期，这两者非常不同，实际上它们由不同的代理负责。此外，我们还有另一个代理专门负责让流失的客户回归，也就是处理流失客户。所以我们有流失客户、高端和低端代理，他们各自有不同的工作流程。目前，我们实际上使用了不同的供应商。是的，目前我们用的是不同的供应商。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Okay. And so previously before this future world, how many SDRs did you have? How many salespeople in this house?
(中文): 好的。那么在这个未来世界之前，你们有多少个SDR？这个团队里有多少销售人员？

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: We would have two to three SDRs and up to five AEs.
(中文): 我们将有两到三名销售开发代表和最多五名客户经理。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Okay. So like eight, nine people full-time working on SaaStr to bring in sponsors and to bring in tickets.
(中文): 好的。大约有八、九个人全职负责SaaStr的工作，以吸引赞助商和售票。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Yes. Although ... Yes, a lot of it is inbound and renewals, but yes, to manage that business, to manage the sales side of that business.
(中文): 是的。尽管……是的，其中大部分是入站业务和续约，但没错，要管理那项业务，要管理该业务的销售方面。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Yeah, you mean, manage on it and be successful.
(中文): 是的，你的意思是，管理好它并取得成功。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Yeah, go-to market. Let's call it eight to nine and go-to market. Now we have 1.2.
(中文): 是的，市场推广。我们称之为八到九点，然后进行市场推广。现在我们有了1.2。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: 1.2-
(中文): 1.2

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Humans.
(中文): 人类。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: 1.2 humans.
(中文): 1.2 个人类。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: And 20 agents, AI agents.
(中文): 以及20个智能体，人工智能智能体。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: What is a 0.2 human?
(中文): 什么是0.2人类？

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Amelia, who's our chief AI officer who runs everything. She spends 20% of her time managing the agents, orchestrating the agents.
(中文): 阿米莉亚，我们的首席人工智能官，负责管理一切事务。她将20%的时间用于管理这些智能体，协调它们的运作。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Okay.
(中文): 好的。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Which is something I think people don't-
(中文): 我认为这是人们不常——

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Let's get into that.
(中文): 让我们开始吧。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: They talk about, but they don't actually understand what that means.
(中文): 他们谈论着，但实际上并不理解那意味着什么。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Yeah. Okay. I definitely want to spend time there. Okay. So you used to have about 10 people full-time. Now you have 1.2 humans and you said 20 agents.
(中文): 是的。好的。我肯定想在那里花些时间。好的。那么，你们过去大约有10名全职员工。现在你们有1.2个人类员工，并且你提到了20个智能体。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: 20 agents. Yeah.
(中文): 20名特工。是的。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Okay. And what you're describing is the business is doing very similarly to what it was when you had 10 humans. Now you have 20 agents, the business doing the same.
(中文): 好的。你所描述的是，现在业务运营情况与你雇佣10名员工时非常相似。现在你拥有20个智能代理，业务表现依然相同。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Yeah. Now listen, if I had two more great humans that wanted to join, don't get me wrong, and this is true of every fast-forward startup, I would hire them tomorrow. Okay? And if you go to Vercel, if you go to Replit, if you go to ... They're all going to tell you the same. I was literally in London, we were just at our abundant event with Maggie, who's in the leadership of OpenAI, she said they just can't hire enough enterprise reps now. But what it is replacing are the mid-pack and below. The ones that don't really understand what Linear does. The ones that don't really know what a pull request is or exactly how Replit works, the AI can do better, not than the best, right? So I would love to have more humans, but I'm not going to hire someone that after their third month in the job doesn't know what SaaStr does. I just can't do that one more time. And I don't think you need to ... This is the thing, AI is replacing the jobs people don't want to do today, and it is displacing the mid-pack and the mediocre. Their jobs are at risk. They are at risk. The best humans, it is true that they will get superpowers from AI, but I'm not sure the rest will. It's a cautionary to ... but I would love to have more than one ... but at the end of the day, 1.2 humans is ... plus 20 AI agents is doing about what 10 human GTM did.
(中文): 是的。听着，如果有另外两位优秀的人才想要加入，别误会，这对任何快速发展的初创公司来说都是如此，我明天就会聘用他们。明白吗？如果你去Vercel、去Replit、去任何地方……他们都会告诉你同样的情况。我最近就在伦敦，我们刚和OpenAI的领导层成员玛吉一起参加了我们的丰盛活动，她说他们现在根本招不够企业代表。但AI正在取代的是中等及以下水平的人。那些并不真正理解Linear是做什么的人。那些不清楚拉取请求是什么，或者Replit具体如何运作的人，AI能做得更好——当然不是比最优秀的人更好，对吧？所以我当然希望有更多人才加入，但我不会再聘用那些工作三个月后还不知道SaaStr是做什么的人了。这种事我不能再经历一次。而且我认为你也不需要……关键在于，AI正在取代人们今天不想做的工作，它正在排挤中等水平和平庸的人。他们的工作岌岌可危。他们确实面临风险。最优秀的人才确实会从AI中获得超能力，但我不确定其他人是否也能如此。这是一个警示……但我也希望能有不止一个……不过归根结底，1.2个人类加上20个AI代理，大约能完成过去10个人类GTM（市场进入团队）所做的工作。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Okay. I want to spend time on the different agents you've built, but first of all, just kind of zooming out, having gone through this experience, how do you see the world of go-to market changing next year in the coming years?
(中文): 好的。我想花时间了解你们打造的不同智能体，但首先，从更宏观的视角来看，经历了这一切后，您如何看待未来一年及几年内市场进入策略领域的变化？

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: All the plays work. It's the playbooks that are kind of broken in the age of AI. All the plays work. Outbound still works. Webinars still works. Podcasts still work. Okay? Events still work. All this stuff works. All this stuff works. Why is ElevenLabs out doing a roadshow, right? It works. Why do they go on Lenny's podcast? It works. So the plays all work. It's just the playbooks are broken because for folks that aren't in the age of AI, growth has decelerated so much that nothing seems to work. It's working. It just works so much worse than 2021, but the play still work. They don't have enough ROI. There's not enough budget for old school SaaS from 2021. The ones that are blowing up, the Vercels, the Replits, the ElevenLabs, they have so much demand, so much demand that they're still running the plays, but they're doing them differently. They're doing them from a hyper PLG focus because there's so much demand. And they're often picking and choosing which prospects to contact. So for example, Bolt is probably a distant number three behind Replit and Lovable, right? But one of my old sales guys run sales there. And I talked to them when they went from zero to 50 million in six months. He's like, "We honestly just have so many leads. Half our job is picking which ones to respond to." And he also is like," we closed a seven figure deal we stole from Lovable because no one called them back at Lovable. So your traditional B2B SaaS company, even ones at billions of revenue, even the HubSpots and all of them, they don't have so many great leads, they don't call them back. So that is a different world, not easy, different world. And then this world where nothing seems to be working, it's just because the demand has evaporated. So both ends have an incentive in 2026 to push the limits for AI for go-to market. The ones that are hyper-growing can't touch everybody. They can't do everything. Not everyone like Vercel will build their own internally. We can talk about why most folks should not build. They should buy. For the same reasons it's always been true in software, we can talk about it. At the low end, you still need humans, but ruthless efficiency is going to be the name of the game for 2026. So anything where AI works, the demand is inexhaustible. So everyone is either looking for more efficiency or they just can't service the massive amount of inbound they have.q And so maybe that doesn't totally answer your question or I got a little bit off track, but that's how the world's changing. When we first did this, which wasn't that long ago, in a way, pre the AI explosion, all B2B companies were kind of the same. They grew at somewhat different rates, some blew up faster like a Samsara, some took longer like a UI path, but come on, they all kind of grew the same way for the same ACV, for the same deal size. Now, just like in venture and everything else, it's wildly bifurcated, right? You've got the low end, which is all about price increases and forcing things onto the base. And at the high end, we have something we've never seen since 2020, which is everyone in the market at once. Everyone in the market at once. This is something that people don't understand. Why are these companies doing so well? Why are they blowing up? Because it's not just at the software ... We love this stuff, Lenny, all these new tools, we love them. But it's not one law firm looking at Harvey. It's everyone. It's everyone. It's not a few folks looking at video on the internet. It's everyone trying to make video on the internet.
(中文): 所有打法都有效。只是在AI时代，那些传统营销手册有些失灵了。所有打法都有效。外拓营销依然有效。网络研讨会依然有效。播客依然有效。活动依然有效。所有这些手段都有效。那为什么ElevenLabs要举办路演？因为它有效。为什么他们上Lenny的播客？因为它有效。所以打法本身都没问题，只是营销手册失灵了——因为对尚未融入AI时代的企业而言，增长已大幅放缓到似乎所有方法都失效的程度。其实方法仍然有效，只是效果远不如2021年。问题在于投资回报率不足，2021年那种传统SaaS模式的预算空间已不复存在。

而那些爆发式增长的企业——Vercel、Replit、ElevenLabs——它们面临海量需求，需求多到仍在沿用传统打法，但执行方式已然不同。它们以超强产品驱动增长为核心，因为市场需求实在庞大，甚至需要筛选接洽哪些潜在客户。例如Bolt在Replit和Lovable之后可能只排第三，但我认识的销售主管曾用六个月实现五千万增长，他说："我们线索多到半数工作都在筛选该跟进哪些"，还提到"我们抢下Lovable一个七位数订单，就因为对方没及时回复"。

传统B2B SaaS公司（包括营收数十亿的HubSpot等）根本没有这么多优质线索，更谈不上及时回复。这是两个截然不同的世界。而在另一个世界，所有方法似乎都失效，本质是需求已然枯竭。因此到2026年，两端企业都有动力用AI突破营销极限：高增长企业无法触达所有客户，不可能事必躬亲（不是每个企业都会像Vercel那样自建系统）；低增长企业则需要保持"冷酷效率"。

凡是AI能发挥作用的领域，需求都是无穷尽的。所以企业要么追求更高效率，要么根本处理不完汹涌的 inbound 需求。这可能没有完全回答你的问题，但世界确实在这样变革。就在不久前的AI爆发前夕，所有B2B企业增长模式还大同小异——无论增速快慢，本质上都遵循相同的客单价与交易规模增长路径。

但现在就像风投等领域一样，市场已剧烈分化：低端市场围绕提价与用户留存挣扎，高端市场则出现2020年以来未见的盛况——全体市场参与者同时涌入。这才是人们没看懂的真相：为什么这些公司表现如此耀眼？因为这不是某个律所试用Harvey，而是所有律所都在用；不是少数人尝试网络视频，而是所有人都在创作网络视频。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Because there's a lot of push from the top of like, we need to adopt AI, we need to be more productive-
(中文): 因为高层有很多推动力，比如我们需要采用人工智能，我们需要提高生产力——

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Now, everyone, not the traditional ... The traditional metric was in most categories, three to 5% of prospects would be in market a year. So you'd send a trillion emails and you'd do cold calls and you'd hope maybe 2026 was the time they were willing to dump Salesforce for your new product. So add all that up, 5%. And many categories work north of 50% in market. So that just totally changes ... the plays still work. Showing up in person, actually knowing what the hell you're selling, knowing how to get through procurement, all of those that work. But other than these weird windows, artificial windows in 2020, we've never had so many people in market at once.
(中文): 现在，各位，这不再是传统的方式……传统的衡量标准是，在大多数类别中，一年内只有3%到5%的潜在客户处于市场活跃期。所以你会发送海量邮件，进行陌生电话推销，然后希望或许2026年就是他们愿意放弃Salesforce转而选择你新产品的时机。把这些加起来，也就5%。而许多类别的市场活跃度实际上超过50%。这彻底改变了……虽然那些常规策略依然有效。亲自到场、真正了解你所销售的产品、懂得如何通过采购流程，所有这些都行得通。但除了2020年那些特殊的、人为创造的窗口期外，我们从未有过如此多的人同时处于市场活跃状态。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: And this is for AI products specifically or beyond that?
(中文): 这是专门针对AI产品还是更广泛的领域？

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Yeah, that have massive ROI.
(中文): 是的，那具有巨大的投资回报率。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Yeah. Productivity.
(中文): 是的。生产力。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: I need to bring a Vibecode tool into my company, Lenny. Okay, go out and do the work, compare Replit, Lovable, and whoever else and buy one. Okay? Why are Harvey and the others and the Goro are doing ... I mean, they're great tools, but everyone is like, we need to automate how we review contracts and documents with AI now. They want a leader and they're going to do it. And that will slow down. Not everybody can be in market every year. It's an exhausting enterprise. So this is a version of the AI bubble that will end and we will revert in some ways to old school, but when everybody is in market, it just changes how you run the whole thing. So the fastest growing ones and the slowest growing ones both have incentives to use AI here, just for different reasons.
(中文): 我需要把Vibecode工具引入我们公司，Lenny。好的，出去完成这项工作，比较Replit、Lovable以及其他任何工具，然后购买一个。明白吗？为什么Harvey和其他人以及Goro都在做...我是说，它们都是很棒的工具，但现在每个人都觉得，我们需要用AI自动化审查合同和文件的方式。他们想要一个领导者，并且会付诸行动。而这会减缓进程。不是每个人都能每年都进入市场。这是一项令人筋疲力尽的事业。所以这是AI泡沫的一个版本，终将结束，我们会在某些方面回归传统方式，但当每个人都进入市场时，它就会改变你整个运营的方式。因此，增长最快的和最慢的都有动力在这里使用AI，只是出于不同的原因。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: How about the sales profession specifically? Are SDRs going to be replaced fully AEs? How do you see the future of the sales profession?
(中文): 具体到销售行业呢？SDR（销售开发代表）会被完全取代，由AE（客户经理）接手吗？您如何看待销售职业的未来？

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: The classic SDR junior kid that is hired out of college to send emails and respond to inbound emails and maybe get back to them later that day or the next day, we don't need them. We're not going to need most of them. SDRs that knock on doors in a lot of industries aren't going to be displaced. The email-based cadence SDR will be 90% displaced by AI next year. People have different nomenclature. I call BDRs, folks that qualify leads coming in, the contact needs that we see. We have no need for them today. They should be extinct next year. There is no reason in the age of AI. I have Hit contact me, wait a day or two for a 21-year-old that doesn't know what Linear does to say, "Hey, what do you do? How much are you willing to pay me? Maybe I'll set up a call with Lenny later this week." There is no need to do that with AI. Our AI alone, one of our agent fully qualifies everybody on the website, so they don't even know they're being qualified and just sets up the meeting with the salesperson. So this email-based SDR and this human qualifying leads, which is not good for the customer. It doesn't feel good to be qualified, does it? They will be mostly extinct next year. I'm guessing with your ... Now the AE, the classic human doing the sales, most of the tools aren't there yet for the most part. I think 70% of their jobs will be safe by the end of next year, but I think it will decline to 40 or 50. I don't think there's any reason what we're seeing in other categories, a great agent can't close a deal too. If there's not a lot to negotiate on price and the agent knows the product better than a human, at least for folks like you and me, I mean, do you like to talk to a human in sales?
(中文): 那种典型的初级销售开发代表，刚从大学毕业就被雇来发邮件、回复收到的邮件，可能当天晚些时候或第二天才回复，我们不需要这样的人。我们将来也不会需要他们中的大多数。在许多行业里，上门拜访的销售开发代表不会被取代。但基于邮件节奏的销售开发代表明年将有90%被人工智能取代。人们有不同的叫法。我把业务开发代表称为那些筛选潜在客户的人，也就是我们看到的联系人需求。我们今天已经不需要他们了。明年他们就应该被淘汰了。在人工智能时代，这完全没有必要。比如有人联系我，却要等一两天，让一个21岁、连Linear是做什么都不知道的人来问：“嘿，你是做什么的？你愿意付多少钱？也许我这周晚些时候可以安排你和Lenny通个电话。”有了人工智能，就没必要这么做了。单凭我们的人工智能，我们的一个智能体就能完全筛选网站上的每个人，他们甚至不知道自己正在被筛选，就直接和销售人员安排了会议。所以这种基于邮件的销售开发代表，以及这种人工筛选潜在客户的方式，对客户来说并不好。被人筛选的感觉并不好受，对吧？明年他们大部分都会被淘汰。我猜你的……至于客户经理，也就是传统的人工销售，目前大部分工具还达不到要求。我认为到明年年底，他们70%的工作还是安全的，但我觉得这个比例会下降到40%或50%。我不认为我们在其他领域看到的情况有什么理由不适用于此，一个优秀的智能体也能完成交易。如果价格上没有太多可谈判的空间，而且智能体比人类更了解产品，至少对于像你我这样的人来说，我的意思是，你喜欢和人类销售员交谈吗？

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Sometimes. I'd rather just chat with a really smart AI.
(中文): 有时。我宁愿只和一个真正聪明的人工智能聊天。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Yeah. So that's all in progress now, but the classic ... And the tough part, and a lot of folks ask this question, Lenny, they say, "Okay, Jason, I see that in your data. How are we going to build the sales profession if there's no entry level jobs in SDRs and AEs?" And that's a Meta question across all of AI. We're already seeing AI concentrate strength in sort of mid-tier folks, isn't it? And we're already seeing lots of folks cut back on entry level hires, Shopify's and others aside, where they'd rather have the six or seven-year-old engineer that's a cursor machine rather than train some kid. It's just more efficient today. I'm sure you see that across a lot of folks you talk to. It's going to happen in sales too. So the folks that know how to manage an agent, work with an agent, the folks that know their product for real, they're going to become more valuable and the rest are going to become less valuable.
(中文): 是的。所以这一切都在进行中，但经典的问题是……难点在于，很多人问这个问题，莱尼，他们说：“好吧，杰森，我在你的数据中看到了这一点。如果SDR和AE都没有入门级岗位，我们该如何培养销售专业人才呢？”这其实是整个AI领域的一个元问题。我们已经看到AI正在将力量集中在中层人才身上，不是吗？而且我们已经看到很多公司削减了入门级招聘，除了Shopify等公司外，他们更愿意雇佣有六七年经验、能熟练操作光标工具的工程师，而不是培训新人。这在当下确实更高效。我相信你在与很多人交流时也看到了这一点。销售领域同样会发生这种情况。因此，那些懂得如何管理智能体、与智能体协作的人，那些真正了解产品的人，将变得更有价值，而其他人则会逐渐贬值。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: It's interesting because I'm an investor in a bunch of startups, as are you, and I'm actually seeing a lot of asks for go-to market people, salespeople. Do you think this is kind of a temporary because there's so much demand they're like, "Oh, we need people to help." And then, this will start to become more AI over time or are they just looking for these really senior people that you're talking about?
(中文): 这很有趣，因为我投资了许多初创公司，你也是，而且我确实看到很多公司在寻找市场推广人员和销售人员。你认为这是暂时的吗？因为需求很大，他们可能会想，“哦，我们需要人手来帮忙。”然后，随着时间的推移，这会不会逐渐被AI取代？或者他们只是在寻找你提到的那种资深人才？

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Well, listen, whether you're managing humans or orchestrating agents, you need leadership. We've yet to produce an autonomous CEO. I know folks talk about how ... on Twitter that AI will replace the CEO, but I don't know that that's literal as much as figurative, right? So we're still going to need the C-suite. We're still going to need VPs. I mean, it's become so much work to manage a million leads, right? A half a million leads. So we need these leaders whether ... The question is, and I've seen your call out there and I saw your tweet on it. The question is, how many of the folks that had the current playbooks are the right folks for the future? I'm thinking maybe 20% of the folks I talk to. 20 are still panicking about AI and I'll tell you how to be in the 20% if you want to know, but I think very few like the Janine from Vercel are going to make the jump, so we'll see. There will be huge organizations, right? Like Denise just went from Slack and Salesforce after 14 years to be CRO of OpenAI. She's working going to be pretty high level, right? So she may not need to know how to implement the agents, but most of the folks your companies want to hire, I would just make sure that they really want to roll up their sleeves and do the job of 2026, 2027, right? Just because they worked at Slack does not necessarily mean they have the skills at your startup.
(中文): 听着，无论是管理人类还是协调智能体，领导力都是不可或缺的。我们至今尚未创造出能完全自主运营的CEO。我知道有些人在推特上讨论AI将取代CEO，但在我看来，这种说法更多是象征性的，而非字面意义上的，对吧？因此，我们仍然需要高管团队，仍然需要副总裁。毕竟，管理百万甚至五十万条潜在客户线索的工作量已经变得如此庞大，不是吗？所以，无论怎样，我们都需要这些领导者。问题在于——我注意到你在外界的呼吁和你相关的推文——当前掌握运营手册的人中，有多少能适应未来的需求？据我观察，可能只有大约20%的交流对象符合条件。另外20%的人仍在为AI感到恐慌，如果你想知道如何跻身那20%，我可以告诉你方法，但像Vercel的Janine那样能够成功转型的人恐怕寥寥无几，我们拭目以待。未来仍会有大型组织存在，对吧？比如Denise，她在Slack和Salesforce工作了14年后，刚刚成为OpenAI的首席营收官。她的工作层级会相当高，对吧？因此她可能不需要亲自了解如何实施智能体，但对于你们公司想要招聘的大多数人，我建议务必确认他们是否真心愿意卷起袖子，投身2026、2027年的实际工作。仅仅因为他们曾在Slack工作过，并不代表他们具备在你们初创公司所需的技能。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: You said that you had some tips for folks to actually be this 20%. If someone's listening to this like, "Oh man, my job is in trouble. What should I focus on?"
(中文): 你说过你有一些建议，能帮助人们真正成为那20%的人。如果有人听到这里心想："天哪，我的工作岌岌可危。我该重点做些什么呢？"

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: It's going to sound simple. It will work and almost nobody is doing this. Pick a tool, an agent, an agentic tool to solve one of your problems. It doesn't almost ... Just one that's the most painful or the one that's most acute. It could be support, it could be SDR, it could be inbound qualification. Pick one, pick a leading vendor. I don't care which one it is. We can talk about how to pick a vendor, but pick a leading vendor that treats you well, that you like, and do it yourself. Train the agent, ingest the data, do the iterations, understand how this damn thing works. Okay? The folks that are lost today have never done it. We literally ... we've turned it into a consulting shop, Lenny. It's kind of crazy. I don't know what I think about it, but we literally just did a job. Amelia, our chief AI officer and Mia, she drove it. We did a call with a public B2B company worth well over 10 billion that you would think is an AI leader, okay? And we did a call with their team and they're like, "We want to figure out this AI SDR stuff." We're like, "Great. We think we're just going to buy this tool and just give it to our SDRs to figure it out on their own." One, no chance. Two, we asked them, "How much of this have you done yourself? Have you done it yourself?" And it was just crickets on this call of 20 people. No one had done it theirself. So they thought they could take an untrained agent with no training and just magically give it to a bunch of young 20-year-old SDRs and this magically would sell on its own. It doesn't work that way. So the way all these agents work is there's a lot of jargon, which is intimidating, ingestion, orchestration, training. It's not that hard, guys. It's just different. It's the same B2B stuff we've been doing for over a decade. You go to a website, you give it a URL of your website, you give it a URL of what your Wiki is, you give it a URL of your training docs. Maybe you upload your prospectus, you upload a few documents, it ingests the data and ingesting means it uploads. It means it processes the data and it does some other stuff that you don't really need to know, some ragging, some vectoring. It really doesn't matter. You upload some stuff and it kind of knows it and isn't great at it. And then ideally, it will turn it into questions. ... great at it. And then ideally it will turn it into questions. And you answer these questions and the more you answer and train it, training is just answering questions and getting better and better. So first you upload a bunch of your stuff, then you spend hours training it, often with the help of a vendor, someone called the Forward Deployed Engineer, which is a scary term, it means someone's going to help you do this. You upload your stuff, you try to get it right, and then you basically have to make sure it's right. QA, testing. And every day when that AI SDR sends out emails and do practice emails, they will say some dumb things. Maybe it's hallucinations, it really doesn't matter what the technical term is, and you correct it. And if you do this for 30 days, then every day you spend an hour or two correcting those mistakes. By the 30th day, it's going to be pretty good. Anyone can do this that has been in B2B or SaaS. Anyone can do what I just described. It is not that different than other things we've done. It's just sequenced differently. But nobody does this. Everyone's panicked. And if you can go do this, pick any tool, pick Agentforce, pick Qualified, pick Artisan, pick whatever you want, if you can go do this and get it live into production, you're hyper employable. All the companies you talked about, the GTM person, they will hire you. You could magically be their chief agentic GTM officer because almost anyone can do this if they want to. It's just going to take a month of your time and it might take you 50 or 60 hours plus qualifying the vendor. And in the old days, when we first did our podcast, you'd hire an agency and disappear. That's how you do this stuff. The agencies don't know how to do this. You've got to do it yourself. But if you do, man, you will rock. You will just rock and you will learn. And you will learn the limits and you will learn the agent can... what it can do and where it can't do. And then you will learn how to do the next one. So we're pretty far on Agentforce, which is Salesforce's one, which Mark talks a lot about, but we're probably one of the only organizations of our size on it. I will tell you a cheat code, which is pretty interesting. We had three of these agents working for sales. After training it and learning it and spending months time to learn it, we got it down to one prompt. And prompt is another almost intimidating word. A string of text that describes what you want this thing to do. We took that prompt and gave it to Agentforce. Then the day was pretty good. If you can do one of these, it'll be really hard. It'll be brutal. Then the second one will be easier. And then you're going to be like the master of the universe in AI if you can do it yourself. But if you're waiting for people on your team to do it, if you're waiting for an agency to do it, I think you're going to be out of a job. Everyone comes to us as experts. We're only experts because we did it 20 times.
(中文): 这听起来很简单。它会奏效，而且几乎没人这么做。选择一个工具、一个智能体、一个智能体工具来解决你的某个问题。不必纠结……就选最棘手或最紧迫的那个。可以是客服支持，可以是销售开发代表（SDR），可以是入站线索筛选。选一个，选一家头部供应商。具体是哪家我不在乎。我们可以讨论如何选择供应商，但一定要选一家服务好、你喜欢的头部供应商，然后亲自动手。训练这个智能体，导入数据，反复调试，搞明白这玩意儿到底怎么运作。明白吗？如今那些迷茫的人从未真正实践过。说真的……我们已经把它变成了一项咨询业务，莱尼。这有点疯狂。我也不知道该怎么看待，但我们确实刚完成一个项目。我们的首席人工智能官阿米莉亚，还有米娅，她主导了这次合作。我们和一家市值远超100亿美元的上市B2B公司通了电话——你会以为他们是人工智能领域的领军者，对吧？我们和他们的团队通话时，他们表示："我们想搞清楚这个人工智能SDR是怎么回事。"我们说："太好了。我们正打算直接购买这个工具，然后交给我们的SDR们自己去摸索。"第一，这根本行不通。第二，我们问他们："你们自己动手做过多少？你们亲自动手试过吗？"电话那头的20个人一片沉默。没有一个人亲自尝试过。所以他们以为，可以拿一个未经训练的智能体，不加任何调教，就神奇地交给一群20岁出头的年轻SDR，然后它就能自动完成销售。事情不是这样运作的。所有这些智能体的工作方式涉及大量术语，听起来很吓人：数据摄取、流程编排、训练。但其实没那么难，各位。只是方式不同而已。这和我们十多年来一直在做的B2B业务本质上是一样的。你访问一个网站，提供你公司网站的URL，提供内部维基的URL，提供培训文档的URL。也许你上传产品说明书，上传几份文件，它就会摄取数据——"摄取"其实就是上传。意味着它处理数据，并进行一些你无需深究的操作，比如RAG（检索增强生成）、向量化等。这些真的不重要。你上传一些资料，它就能大致理解，虽然一开始可能不太擅长。理想情况下，它会将这些内容转化为问题……然后你回答这些问题，你回答得越多、训练得越多——训练其实就是不断回答问题并让它变得越来越好。所以首先你上传一堆资料，然后花几个小时训练它，通常会有供应商提供帮助，比如他们所谓的"前线部署工程师"——这个头衔听起来吓人，其实就是会有人帮你做这件事。你上传资料，努力调整到正确状态，然后基本上必须确保它运行无误。进行质量保证和测试。每天，当那个AI SDR发送邮件或进行练习邮件时，它可能会说一些蠢话。也许是幻觉问题，具体技术术语是什么并不重要，你纠正它就行。如果你坚持这样做30天，每天花一两个小时修正那些错误，到第30天，它就会相当出色了。任何有B2B或SaaS经验的人都能做到。任何人都能做到我刚才描述的事情。这和我们以往做的其他事情并没有太大不同，只是步骤顺序有所调整。但就是没人这么做。所有人都在恐慌。如果你能行动起来，随便选一个工具——选Agentforce、选Qualified、选Artisan，选任何你想要的——如果你能真正动手实践并让它上线运行，你就会变得极具就业竞争力。你提到的所有公司，那些负责市场拓展的人，都会争相聘用你。你甚至可能神奇地成为他们的首席智能体市场拓展官，因为只要愿意，几乎任何人都能做到。这只需要花费你一个月的时间，大概50到60个小时，再加上筛选供应商。放在以前，比如我们刚开始做播客的时候，你会雇个代理然后撒手不管。但处理这类事情，代理根本不知道怎么做。你必须亲力亲为。但如果你做到了，老兄，你会脱颖而出。你会大放异彩，并且在这个过程中学习。你会了解它的局限性，明白智能体能做什么、不能做什么。然后你就会知道如何着手下一个项目。我们在Agentforce（Salesforce的产品，马克经常谈论它）上已经走得很远了，但像我们这种规模的组织，可能没几家在用。我可以告诉你一个取巧的方法，挺有意思的。我们让三个这样的智能体负责销售工作。经过数月的训练、学习和摸索，我们最终把它简化为一条指令。"指令"是另一个听起来有点唬人的词，其实就是一串描述你希望这个工具做什么的文字。我们拿着这条指令交给Agentforce，效果就相当不错了。如果你能独立完成其中一个项目，过程会非常艰难，堪称残酷。但第二个就会容易些。然后，如果你能亲自动手，你就会成为人工智能领域的顶尖高手。但如果你指望团队里的其他人来做，或者指望代理机构来做，恐怕你会面临失业风险。所有人都把我们当作专家。我们之所以是专家，仅仅是因为我们亲手实践了20次。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: I think what might be helpful here actually is to do a tour, kind of a quick tour of the agents that you've built and what they do, which ones have been most impactful. And then as you do that, what products you use, what powers these agents that you like and maybe don't like.
(中文): 我认为这里真正有帮助的，其实是进行一次快速巡览，介绍一下你们已构建的智能体及其功能，哪些产生了最大影响。接着在介绍过程中，说明你们使用了哪些产品、驱动这些智能体的技术核心是什么，以及你们喜欢或可能不太满意的方面。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: If anyone goes to SaaStr.ai/agents, you'll see everything we built. It's all bulleted out. You can copy us and I'll walk you through it. But two caveats are things at the top. I built a lot of stuff in Replit. We can talk about it for fun. I'm a top 1% user. I love it. None of the GTM stuff we built ourselves. Don't build it yourself. You're not Vercel. You don't have a full-time, wicked awesome engineer that wants to build this. Could all this stuff be built yourself? It's the same idea of building your own Notion. You could do it, but don't do it. These products are expensive. They're not so expensive it's worth... and then maintaining. The pace of innovation is so fast. Even if you can hire someone to build it internally, it will become obsolete if you're not careful in a couple months. We've built a lot of stuff. We could talk about... I built a calculator to do startup calculations, been used 800,000 times in 90 days.
(中文): 如果有人访问SaaStr.ai/agents，就能看到我们构建的所有内容。全部以要点形式列出。你们可以复制我们的做法，我会带你们一步步了解。但首先有两点需要注意。我在Replit上开发了很多东西，我们可以当作趣事聊聊。我是该平台排名前1%的用户，非常喜欢它。至于我们自行构建的GTM（市场推广）相关工具——千万别自己动手做。你们不是Vercel，也没有专职的顶尖工程师愿意投入这个领域。这些东西能自己搭建吗？这就像自己开发Notion一样，技术上可行，但千万别这么做。这些产品价格不菲，其成本并非物有所值……后续维护更是问题。技术迭代速度极快，即便能招聘内部人员开发，稍不注意几个月后就会过时。我们构建了许多工具，比如我做的初创企业计算器——90天内已被使用80万次。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: For valuation, right?
(中文): 是为了估值，对吗？

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Yeah, for valuations. I built a pitch deck reviewer that's reviewed almost 3,000 pitch decks. Lots of fun stuff, but none of the GTM stuff we built ourselves. None of it. Just a caveat, don't build it yourself, unless you're Vercel, unless you have a reason. That was a great pod. It was wonderful. Don't do it. Don't do that yourself.
(中文): 是的，关于估值方面。我开发了一个商业计划书审阅工具，已经审阅了近3000份商业计划书。其中有很多有趣的内容，但没有一份涉及我们自己构建的GTM（市场进入策略）相关内容。完全没有。只是提醒一下，除非你是Vercel，或者有特殊理由，否则不要自己动手构建这类工具。那期播客节目很棒，非常精彩。别这么做，千万别自己尝试。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Basically, unless you have awesome go-to-market engineers.
(中文): 基本上，除非你拥有出色的市场推广工程师。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: And they really want to do it. They really are chomping at the bit to do it. Don't do it. So I started... and this is not where other folks would start, but there's some learnings. I started, there's an app called Delphi, which makes digital clones. You used it for the Lenny Bot a long time ago. I saw you do-
(中文): 他们确实很想这么做。他们简直是迫不及待地想要行动。但请不要这样做。于是我开始……虽然这不是其他人会选择的起点，但其中有些值得学习的经验。我启动了一个名为Delphi的应用，它能够制作数字克隆。你很久以前用它制作过Lenny机器人。我看到你当时——

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Lennybot.com.
(中文): Lennybot.com。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: What's that? Yeah, Lennybot.com.
(中文): 那是什么？是的，Lennybot.com。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Lennybot.com. Yeah, check it out.
(中文): Lennybot.com。是的，去看看。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: I saw it a long time ago. It was interesting, but it didn't click. And then Brian Halligan, who's the founder and chairman of HubSpot, did one too. They're Sequoia backed, and he was working at Sequoia, so he helped them early on. And then I kind of had a magic moment, and this is the way it works in AI, when I saw the combination of the two. People should love Lenny Bot because if folks haven't tried it, try it. It is ingested, I know a scary term for some, it is ingested every single interview you've ever done. Every word of content you've written. And it can combine them all together. It can combine the Vercel story and what you did with Dylan at Figma, and it can synthesize the knowledge, and it's pretty good. It's pretty good. What I liked about Brian's better than yours, though, was that it was Brian. And Lenny Bot is kind of Lenny, but it's also kind of all your guests. I think that's the superpower of it, right?
(中文): 我很久以前就看到过。它很有趣，但当时没有引起我的共鸣。后来HubSpot的创始人兼董事长布莱恩·哈利根也做了一个。他们是红杉资本投资的，而布莱恩当时在红杉工作，所以早期帮助了他们。接着我仿佛经历了一个神奇的时刻——这在AI领域很常见——当我看到两者结合时。大家应该会喜欢Lenny Bot，因为如果还没试过的话，不妨试试看。它会"摄取"（我知道这个词对有些人来说有点吓人），它会摄取你进行过的每一次访谈、你写过的每一个字内容。然后它能将这些全部整合起来，既能结合Vercel的故事，也能融合你在Figma与迪伦的合作经历，还能综合这些知识——而且效果相当不错。不过，比起你的版本，我更喜欢布莱恩那版的原因在于：那就是布莱恩本人。而Lenny Bot虽然带有伦尼的特质，却也融合了所有嘉宾的特点。我想这正是它的超能力所在，对吧？

[Lenny Rachitsky]: That's the way I think about it. It's not just my intelligence. It's the lessons of every single person I've had on this podcast.
(中文): 这就是我的思考方式。这不仅仅是我个人的智慧，更是每一位参与过这档播客的嘉宾所带来的宝贵经验。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: So it's great, but I thought, "Hey, maybe I could finally do one that's in between the two." I've been a founder and I've written 10,000 pieces of content. So that's a little bit like Brian, but I have more than Brian. And I'm not Lenny in terms of productivity, but I've got a lot of voices. So I'm like, "I'll try it." I used Delphi. I instantly broke it because I had too much data to ingest. It took about a week to get going and it worked. And it's just like you. Some people spend hours a day on Digital Jason in another browser and they don't do what they do with Lenny, but they'll ask about their sales woes and what to do with their sales team and they'll upload LinkedIns and ask if they should hire people. And then a curious thing happened, which is that because we do these events, people started to use it for questions for the events. "Hey, how do I get a refund? Hey, can I get a discount? Hey, where is the San Mateo County Fairgrounds?" So Jason Live is really in the San Francisco Bay Area. "Who's speaking?" There's endless questions. And we used to use PreFin Intercom, and we're so busy, we would answer two weeks later. It was worst support ever. And the agent just started doing support on its own. And then it did this thing where it sold sponsorship on its own. So one place to start if you haven't started is in support. And you don't have to buy Sierra and you don't have to buy DecaCon necessarily and you don't have to buy Finn, but one potential place to start is can you do great 24/7 support? Can you? Most apps can't. In fact, some of the worst offenders are AI leaders. They have no support at all on their website. So that's one place to start. And then the next place we started... so for us, the login for the next place we started is, "Hey, we want to try Outbound." Because we don't have 1.2,000,000 names like you have, but we have 400,000 and we have data on them. So we wanted to say, "Hey, come back to our SaaStr event." So we didn't know what to use. And I'll tell you some learning. So we picked a YC company called Artisan. They've gone from nothing to $10,000,000 this year. We picked them, but this is important why. They were a sponsor at SaaStr, we didn't know, and they offered to help us the most. This is the critical insight. We didn't know if Artisan was the... I have opinions now. We hadn't deployed it, but another vendor, the CRO argued with us. He said, "I need $100K upfront before I help you." Another one said they were scared of SaaStr. They didn't want bad PR if it failed. Fair.
(中文): 这很棒，但我当时想："嘿，或许我终于可以做一个介于两者之间的产品。"我曾是创始人，也创作过上万篇内容。这有点像布莱恩的风格，但我的积累比他更丰富。虽然论产出效率我不及莱尼，但我拥有更多元的声音表达。所以我就决定："试试看吧。"我用了Delphi平台，结果立刻把它弄崩溃了——因为要处理的数据量实在太大了。花了大约一周时间才让它运转起来，效果居然和你使用时的情形如出一辙。

有些人每天在另一个浏览器里花数小时与"数字版杰森"互动，他们不会像对待莱尼那样深度使用，但会咨询销售困境、销售团队管理问题，上传领英资料询问是否该招聘某人。后来发生了件有趣的事：因为我们举办各类活动，人们开始用它咨询活动相关问题。"怎么申请退款？能打折吗？圣马特奥县展览馆怎么走？"毕竟杰森现场活动主要在旧金山湾区举办。"演讲嘉宾是谁？"问题层出不穷。

我们以前用PreFin Intercom客服系统时，因为太忙总要两周后才回复，堪称史上最差客服体验。而现在这个智能客服开始自主处理支持请求，后来甚至独立完成了赞助销售。所以如果你还没起步，客服领域是个不错的切入点。你不必购买Sierra、DecaCon或Finn这些系统，但可以思考：能否提供优质的24/7全天候客服支持？你能做到吗？大多数应用都做不到。事实上，有些最糟糕的案例恰恰来自AI领域的领头企业——它们的网站根本没有客服渠道。

接下来我们开拓的领域是...对我们而言，新尝试的切入点是："我们想试试外联推广。"虽然我们没有你们那样120万的用户名单，但我们拥有40万用户及其相关数据。我们想通过外联邀请他们回归SaaStr活动。当时我们不确定该用什么工具，这里分享些经验：我们选了家YC孵化的公司Artisan，他们今年从零增长到千万美元规模。选择他们有个重要原因——这家公司其实是SaaStr的赞助商（我们事先不知情），而且他们提供了最鼎力的支持。关键洞察在于：我们当时并不确定Artisan是否最适合...现在我有自己的判断了。在尚未部署时，另一家供应商的CRO竟与我们争执，要求"先付10万美元才提供帮助"；还有供应商坦言害怕与SaaStr合作，担心项目失败引发负面舆论。这倒可以理解。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Yeah. A certain company [inaudible 00:33:43].
(中文): 是的。某家公司[听不清 00:33:43]。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: "We don't want to be your first." And Artisan said, "We'll do it." And we had nothing. And here's the interesting thing about agentic stuff, it's like support. If you have nothing, it doesn't have to change the world. If you're literally doing nothing and you start to do something that's high ROI, you're going to get return. So we did that one. We trained it. It's great. We did about 60,000 emails, saw pretty high rates. Then we said, "Well, we'll try inbound. We don't want to have this depressing experience where a salesperson quits and it's two weeks later until they talk to..." So we used this vendor called Qualified, which was founded by the ex CMO of Salesforce that does a lot now, but mostly focused on Qualified stuff. That immediately worked. We had someone at 11:00 PM on Saturday night that wanted to sponsor and they sponsored and it worked and it worked great. But again, they helped us.
(中文): "我们不想成为你的第一个。"而Artisan说："我们会做的。"我们当时一无所有。关于主动性事务的有趣之处在于，它就像支持一样。如果你一无所有，它不必改变世界。如果你真的什么都没做，然后开始做一些高回报率的事情，你就会得到回报。所以我们做了那个项目。我们训练了它。效果很好。我们处理了大约6万封邮件，看到了相当高的成功率。然后我们说："好吧，我们试试入站营销。我们不想经历那种令人沮丧的情况，销售人员离职后，要等两周才能联系到……"所以我们使用了名为Qualified的供应商，它由Salesforce的前首席营销官创立，现在业务广泛，但主要专注于Qualified相关服务。这立刻见效了。我们在周六晚上11点遇到一个想要赞助的人，他们赞助了，效果很好，非常成功。但同样，他们帮助了我们。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: And this is an agent that is emailing with prospect selling them on a sponsorship.
(中文): 这是一位正在与潜在客户通过电子邮件沟通，向他们推销赞助合作的代理人。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Well, it's literally, if you go to SaaStrAnnual.com, and anyone should buy a product like this, it doesn't have to be Qualified, and the bubble, the intercom-like bubble, is tuned to qualifying inbound prospects. Folks that say, "Hey, I want to sponsor Lenny's podcast." "Sorry, we're sold out through 2028, but if you want to be on the wait list, sign up here." Or even better for us, it would qualify folks out that weren't a good fit. It would save so much time, and it would do it 24 hours, then it would just set up the meeting. So the reason that was a great second one was because no one was willing to do that. No human was willing to pick up the phone and talk to these people. So it was such low-hanging fruit. But the key to the first two, and if you're going to pick an agent, is they offered to help the most. At the end of the day, Lenny, these are all running on Claude 4. They're all basically using a bunch of APIs mashed together. That's not new to software, mashing a bunch of APIs under the hood. But deep down, I don't want to trigger anybody, many of these, the leaders in AI GTM, they're more similar than different. They're more similar than different under the hood. It doesn't mean the features are parity. So because you have to train them, because it takes a month, the world's best software with no help training you is not one 99% of people should buy. In the old days, we would qualify the best software. We would make a matrix and we would do their thing and we would compare features and do it. You've got to do another column, which is your Forward Deployed Engineer or solution architect or your SE and talk to them and say, "Who is going to help me?" And before you write a check, get on the phone with Lenny and see if Lenny's really going to do deployment. And if Lenny rocks and the other vendor is better and won't help you, don't do it. And that's why we've had so much success is the first two we did, yeah, they were startups, so they worked harder, but Artisan and Qualified just did the work with us. And we're not stupid, but it was work. We needed help. And so that's what I learned is, you have this partner, the FDE and the vendor, and a lot of them actually might not take your business if they don't think they can help you. The best ones turn away a lot of business today, which is interesting. An interesting learning from this for folks is a lot of folks say, and they would say it to you if you use these, Lenny, they say, "You have too much data. SaaStr is not like us. We're a startup, we're tiny. You have 400,000 people in your database. Lenny has 1.2,000,000. I only have 300 customers or 200 customers." What I've learned is that's wrong. If you have 300 customers, how many folks have come to your website ever? 30,000. How many leads do you have? How many folks in your database? How many folks have you tried to reach out before? More than a human's doing. And all of a sudden they have aha moment. "How many folks do you have in your HubSpot? How many folks do you have in your CRM?" They look it up. 31,000. "Okay. How many folks do you have talking to them? Zero." You don't need the scale of numbers that you and I have to make these agents work. You need a little bit of scale and you need a little bit of traffic, but not as much as you think. So all the learnings, we have a lot of folks that honestly, they don't want to do the work. They're like, "Well, SaaStr has a lot of scale. They have a lot of years." It's not true. And it turns out to also be true with the training. I'm sure you've seen it with Lenny Bot. I thought having 12 years of content made the difference. Nah. It's having a couple months of really good content and a long tail beyond that, but you don't need as deep training and as much as you think. You just need a bit to be really good. So anyone that has any scale whatsoever, even a couple million of revenue and up, can benefit from these products. So we did horizontal general bot, got us to a certain place. Then we did SDR for outbound, then we did inbound, and then we did Agentforce really early with Salesforce. And we didn't know what to do with Agentforce at first, but we decided we would reactivate the folks that sales decide was not worth their time. Folks that reached out to sales, and this is true at every startup. We even just talked about some of the AI leaders where a human says, "You know what? I don't think this is enough commission. I'm kind of busy. I got a $4,000,000 deal with Meta going." We just took Agentforce just on those and we trained it on very similar prompt. It had 70% response rate. Those are people that were dying to interact with us. 70% is so good. And this is something humans were not willing to... it wasn't worth their time. And I know this sounds critical and maybe I'm going to trigger some sales folks, but the reality is if you're in a lead-rich environment, and I think that there's lead-rich and lead-poor environments for even big companies but startups. There's not enough, but eventually you become lead-rich. Reps just don't follow up with a lot of them. It's just human nature. Even you. I bet more folks want to sponsor the newsletter than you can let in, right? Do you pick up the phone with all of them?
(中文): 嗯，确切来说，如果你访问SaaStrAnnual.com，任何人想购买这类产品时——它不一定非得是Qualified——那个类似Intercom的对话气泡功能，就是专门用来筛选入站潜在客户的。比如有人问：“我想赞助Lenny的播客。”系统就会回复：“抱歉，我们的赞助位已排到2028年，但如果您愿意加入等候名单，请在此登记。”对我们而言更理想的是，它能直接筛掉那些不合适的对象。这能节省大量时间，而且全天候运行，最后还能自动安排会议。所以它成为我们第二个成功案例的原因在于：没人愿意干这活儿。没有哪个真人愿意接电话跟这些人沟通。这简直是唾手可得的成果。

但前两个案例的关键点（如果你要选择智能代理服务商的话）在于：他们提供了最鼎力的支持。说到底Lenny，这些系统都运行在Claude 4上，本质上都是把一堆API接口拼接起来——这在软件行业并不新鲜，底层都是API的整合。但深层次看，我不想冒犯任何人，很多AI GTM领域的领头羊，它们的底层技术相似度远高于差异度。这不意味着功能完全对等。正因为需要长达一个月的训练期，世界上最好的软件如果缺乏培训支持，99%的人都不该购买。过去我们会评估最佳软件，制作对比矩阵，逐项比较功能。但现在你需要增加新评估项：联系他们的前线部署工程师、解决方案架构师或售前工程师，直接问“谁能真正帮助我？”在签合同前，务必和Lenny通个电话，确认他是否真的会参与部署。如果Lenny非常出色而另一家供应商更优秀却不愿提供支持，那就别选后者。我们之所以能成功，正是因为前两家合作商（没错，他们是初创公司所以更拼）但Artisan和Qualified确实与我们并肩作战。我们并不愚钝，但这确实是项需要协作的工作——我们需要帮助。

我由此领悟到：你需要合作伙伴（前线部署工程师和供应商），而很多优质供应商如果自觉无法提供帮助甚至会拒绝合作。如今最顶尖的服务商会推掉大量业务，这很有意思。从这个案例中得到的启示是：很多人会对你这样说（Lenny如果你用这些系统他们也会这么说）：“你们数据量太大了，SaaStr和我们不一样。我们是初创公司规模很小，你们数据库有40万人，Lenny有120万，而我只有300或200个客户。”但我发现这是认知误区。如果你有300个客户，那累计有多少人访问过你的网站？3万。你有多少潜在客户线索？数据库有多少联系人？你曾尝试联系过多少人？肯定超出人力所能及。他们突然就会恍然大悟：“你们HubSpot里有多少人？CRM系统里有多少联系人？”查一下：3.1万。“那有多少人在主动联系他们？零。”要让这些智能代理发挥作用，你并不需要达到你我这样的数据规模。确实需要一定基数和流量，但远比你想象的要少。

很多人的真实想法是：“SaaStr有规模优势，积累了多年资源。”其实并非如此。训练过程也印证了这点——我相信你在Lenny Bot上也发现了：我曾以为12年的内容积累是关键，其实不然。真正需要的是几个月优质核心内容加上长尾延伸，训练深度和量级都比预期少得多，只需少量优质数据就能见效。所以任何具备一定规模的企业，哪怕是几百万营收级别的，都能从这些产品中受益。

我们先是做了通用型横向机器人，达到一定效果；接着开发了面向外拓的SDR机器人，然后是入站筛选机器人，很早还与Salesforce合作了Agentforce。最初我们不知如何运用Agentforce，后来决定用它重新激活那些被销售判定为“不值得花时间”的客户——那些曾主动联系销售却未被重视的人（这在所有初创公司都很常见）。我们甚至刚和一些AI领军企业聊过，销售员会说：“这单佣金太少，我正忙着处理Meta的四百万美元大单呢。”于是我们专门用Agentforce处理这类客户，用非常相似的提示词训练它，结果获得了70%的回复率——这些人原本迫切希望与我们互动！70%的回复率堪称卓越，而这正是人类销售不愿投入的领域（觉得不值得花时间）。我知道这听起来很尖锐，可能会触动某些销售人员的神经，但现实是：即使对大公司和初创企业而言，也存在线索富集和线索匮乏的环境。初期可能线索不足，但最终都会进入富集状态。而销售代表往往不会跟进大量线索，这是人性使然——连你也一样。我敢说想赞助你新闻稿的人肯定远超你能接纳的数量，对吧？你会接听他们每个人的电话吗？

[Lenny Rachitsky]: I replied to all of them and then we just tell them we're full, but yeah.
(中文): 我回复了他们所有人，然后我们就告诉他们我们已经满员了，不过确实如此。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Yeah. But you see the point, right? Even your scale, you see the point, right?
(中文): 是的。但你明白重点，对吧？即便是你的标准，你明白重点，对吧？

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Yeah. Yeah, it gets challenging.
(中文): 是的。是的，这变得具有挑战性了。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: And let's imagine all of a sudden you had six months of inventory available. I bet if you spooled up an agent and emailed all those folks back automatically, you'd fill up the docket, right?
(中文): 假设突然间你手头有了六个月的库存。我敢打赌，如果你启动一个自动代理，给所有那些人发邮件回复，日程表很快就会被填满，对吧？

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Mm-hmm.
(中文): 嗯。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: So anyone can do these sorts of... you think you can't, unless you're so small that you have sufficient humans to talk with every potential lead, every person that touches your website, every person that clicks with anything, you can benefit from AI. So that was kind of our journey. And then we've done a lot of other niche stuff. I'll tell you at the end where we are today, maybe this is almost too much learning, is we're at the point where maybe we can't do one more. Because right now, when we did Delphi in the beginning, when I copied you with Delphi, even me, I spent almost an hour a day training it in the beginning because when we started to use it for support, it had an initial... it started telling people the wrong dates, and we could talk about why. So I had to fix it and it made some mistakes. And so when people started to use it, I had to spend an hour each morning firing up Delphi, reviewing the issues and answering them. I don't have to do it anymore. It's well-trained. We have so many agents going and so many emails that Amelia has to spend 10 to 15 hours a week reviewing the outputs. And it's exhausting because agents work all night and they work weekends and they work on Christmas. It's a big issue. Being the orchestrator or the chief AI person is not a good job for lazy people because the agents never sleep. So it is so much time now to manage these 20. This is just interesting. I don't know when we're going to do the 21st. We may be full. And for folks that are startups, this is a reason to go harder because everyone was in market this year and it's going to keep happening, but business process change remains an issue for business software. Business process change at the end of the day, and so many founders get this wrong, and 99% of sales folks, they don't care about business process change. Salesforce, they just want to get their commission. It doesn't really matter what you pay for an app for a customer as long as it's fair. It's all the work to change the way you do your business. And so we're at the point where we're overloaded. And so just be aware, if you're a startup or even Salesforce or HubSpot, maybe close those deals in the next 12 months, because the window may close where people say, "Listen, that's the coolest agent I've ever seen. I'm exhausted from the last five. I had to do five last year. I just literally cannot bring one more app into my enterprise." And so that's going to be a headwind that today everything seems like it has tailwinds. Everything's on fire, but people are going to get exhausted for having so many agents. Exhausted.
(中文): 所以任何人都能做这类事情……除非你规模太小，能安排足够人手与每个潜在客户、每个访问网站的用户、每个点击任何内容的访客沟通，否则你会觉得自己做不到——而人工智能能让你从中受益。这大致就是我们的发展历程。之后我们还做了很多其他细分领域的工作。最后我会告诉你我们目前的状况，或许这已经接近学习能力的极限了，我们现在可能无法再增加一个了。因为最初开发Delphi时，当我借鉴你的思路创建Delphi，连我自己在开始时每天都要花近一小时训练它——当我们开始将其用于客服支持时，它初期会告诉用户错误日期，我们可以探讨具体原因。所以我必须修正它的错误。当人们开始使用时，我每天早晨都得花一小时启动Delphi，检查问题并回复。现在我不需要这样做了，它已经训练有素。我们现在有这么多智能代理在处理海量邮件，以至于Amelia每周要花10到15小时审核输出结果。这非常耗费精力，因为这些代理昼夜不停地工作，周末无休，连圣诞节都在运转。这是个严峻的问题。作为协调者或首席人工智能负责人，这对懒人来说绝非好差事——因为代理永远不需要睡眠。现在管理这20个代理就耗费了大量时间。这现象很有意思，我不知道何时会启动第21个，可能我们已经达到承载极限了。对于初创企业而言，这恰恰是应该更努力推进的理由，因为今年所有企业都在涌入市场，这种趋势将持续，但业务流程变革始终是企业软件的痛点。归根结底是业务流程变革问题，太多创业者误解这一点，99%的销售人员也不关心业务流程变革。像Salesforce这样的公司，他们只关心拿到佣金。只要价格合理，客户为应用支付多少并不重要，真正的难点在于改变企业运营方式所需付出的努力。我们现在正处于超负荷状态。所以请注意，无论你是初创公司还是Salesforce或HubSpot这样的企业，或许应该在接下来12个月内完成交易，因为机会窗口可能关闭——人们会说："听着，这是我见过最酷的智能代理，但前五个已经让我筋疲力尽。去年我不得不部署五个，现在真的无法再让一个应用进入我的企业了。"这将形成逆风，而当前一切似乎都顺风顺水。虽然现在一切如火如荼，但人们终将因智能代理过多而疲惫不堪。精疲力尽。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Man, okay. There's so much to learn from in what you just shared. Something I definitely want to ask about, as people hear this, agents sending off emails, agents talking to your clients, I get a ton of emails that are terrible.
(中文): 嗯，好的。你刚才分享的内容确实有很多值得学习的地方。有一点我特别想请教，当人们听到这些关于代理发送邮件、代理与客户沟通的内容时，我收到了大量质量很差的邮件。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Yes.
(中文): 是的。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: What have you learned about making these outbound emails good and not just noise? How do you make these conversations high quality?
(中文): 关于制作这些外发邮件，你学到了什么让它们变得有效而不仅仅是噪音？如何使这些对话保持高质量？

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: It's a really, really, really good question. Maybe the two biggest learnings. Take your best person on your sales team, your best marketer you have, take their email copy and use that as the template for your AI. Everyone in 2024 said these products didn't work. There were two reasons they didn't work. It was before Claude 4. Replit didn't work. Lovable didn't exist. Gamma didn't really work before 2025, right before Claude. The LMs reached this point where they would work for these use cases. So that was one threshold. The other thing that happened in 2024 is the vendors kind of lied and said, "Just turn the product on. It'll get you revenue. No need to train it, no need to do anything. We'll just do everything as this magic AI savant." It's not the way it works this way. What you do is an agent will be successful in go-to-market and sales today if you take what works for your best person, train... I know this seems like a scary term, but it's not. Upload that text. Train the agent on it and let it iterate an A/B test from that. Agents are really good at A/B testing. They're really good at creating variants. Ask Claude for a variant of your best email. Say, "Give me three versions of my best email." They'll be pretty good. That's all the agent has to do is take your best email you ever sent and stick it through an API. I'm making it sound simpler than it is, but not by too much. So train it and then what it'll do and then give it some data sources. And the data source could be as simple as Salesforce. And then if it has any data on Lenny, it can pull data and it can lightly personalize that email. And even better, a lot of these products track all the visitors to your website. So they can see what's happened and they use other APIs and so they can personalize your emails more. And so what ends up happening is the emails that the AI's write are pretty good. If you're getting terrible emails, it's a poorly trained product from a bad vendor. You should be getting emails when you get them and you're like, "This isn't as good as Jason said on Lenny's podcast, but it's pretty good." That's what AI can do today. And the magic is if a human isn't even doing that or if your mediocre humans are worse. And I'll tell you, one of the first lessons I learned when my last startup was acquired by Adobe, Sam Blond was one of our sales leaders, then he became CRO of Brex and others. We inherited a bunch of reps from Adobe. We didn't ask for them. And he's like, "My God, I never read everyone's emails before. These are the worst emails I've ever read." So the AI can do better than that. The AI can do better than that. And so you just train it on your best and it'll be pretty good. You just haven't seen a well-trained agent. And then what I learned, and then another question folks ask is, "Okay, Jason, that email was pretty good. It wasn't as great as you said on stage, but it was pretty good." But do you tell people it's an AI or do you hide it? And what we learned from sending hundreds of thousands is it doesn't matter. We're in an age where people don't really care as long as the email adds value and they know they're going to get an instant response. We've tried both. We've tried to say, "Hey, it's Digital Amelia or Digital Jason." We've tried to fake it. And what we've learned is now we just send it. We just send it and no one cares. Especially founders will get an email back, they'll be like, "Haha, I can tell this is an AI, but it's pretty good. Can I do a meeting?" That kind of says it all, doesn't it?
(中文): 这确实是一个非常、非常、非常好的问题。也许最重要的两点心得是：选取你销售团队中最优秀的人员，或者你最好的营销人员，把他们的邮件文案作为模板来训练你的AI。2024年时大家都说这些产品不好用，原因主要有两个。那时Claude 4还没出现。Replit不好用。Lovable不存在。Gamma在2025年Claude问世前也基本不成熟，对吧？语言模型直到那时才发展到足以支撑这些应用场景，这是第一个关键门槛。2024年发生的另一件事是供应商们某种程度上在夸大其词，声称"只要打开产品就能带来收入，无需训练，无需任何操作，我们的AI就像魔法专家一样全自动搞定"。但实际并非如此。如今要想让智能体在进入市场和销售中取得成功，你需要做的是：将最优秀人员的有效经验进行训练——我知道'训练'这个词听起来有点吓人，但其实不然。上传那些文本，以此训练智能体，然后让它基于此进行A/B测试迭代。智能体非常擅长A/B测试和生成变体。你可以让Claude为你最好的邮件生成变体，比如说"给我三个版本的最佳邮件"，效果会相当不错。智能体要做的其实就是把你发过的最佳邮件通过API处理。虽然我描述得比实际简单了些，但相差并不远。所以先训练它，然后给它一些数据源——简单如Salesforce就可以。如果它有关于Lenny的数据，就能提取信息并稍作个性化处理。更妙的是，很多这类产品能追踪网站所有访客行为，结合其他API数据，实现更深度的邮件个性化。最终AI写的邮件质量会相当不错。如果你收到的邮件很糟糕，那说明是劣质供应商训练不善的产品。当你收到邮件时应该会觉得："虽然不如Jason在Lenny播客里说得那么神奇，但确实挺不错的。"这就是当前AI能达到的水平。更神奇的是，如果人类连这种程度都做不到，或者你团队里的普通员工水平更差——我举个真实例子：我上一家创业公司被Adobe收购时，销售主管Sam Blond（后来成为Brex等公司的CRO）接收了一批Adobe的销售代表。他当时惊叹："天啊，我以前从没读过所有人的邮件，这些是我见过最差的邮件。"而AI完全可以做得比那更好。所以只要用你最好的案例训练AI，它就能表现优异。你只是还没见过训练有素的智能体而已。另一个常被问到的问题是："Jason，那封邮件确实不错，虽然没你在台上说得那么完美，但确实挺好。那你是告诉人们这是AI写的，还是隐瞒呢？"从我们发送数十万封邮件的经验来看，这根本不重要。在这个时代，只要邮件能提供价值且收件人知道能得到即时回复，人们并不在意。我们两种方式都试过——有时标明"这是数字Amelia或数字Jason"，有时尝试伪装。最终我们发现直接发送就行，根本没人计较。尤其是创始人收到回复时常会说："哈哈，我知道这是AI写的，但确实不错。能安排会议吗？"——这句话已经说明了一切，不是吗？

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Mm-hmm.
(中文): 嗯。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: So we're creating issues as excuses to not do the work.
(中文): 所以我们是在制造问题作为不干活的借口。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Your point about how human salespeople's emails are not great already is really powerful because all we're looking at is these okay emails from AI and you're saying, "Okay, but humans, they're not actually that much better if you actually look at them."
(中文): 你提到人类销售人员的邮件本身就不怎么样，这一点很有说服力，因为我们看到的只是这些还过得去的AI邮件，而你在说：“好吧，但如果你仔细看看，人类的邮件其实也没好到哪里去。”

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: My God, they're not. Listen, the best outbound emails you've ever gotten. For example, I know you've done a bunch of investments. A lot of them are inbound to you. They want Lenny involved, right?
(中文): 天哪，他们确实不是。听着，你收到过最棒的推广邮件。比如，我知道你做过很多投资，其中很多都是主动找上门的。他们都希望Lenny参与进来，对吧？

[Lenny Rachitsky]: That's right.
(中文): 没错。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Some of them are just so good you can't believe it, right? A few.
(中文): 其中一些简直好到令人难以置信，对吧？确实有少数如此。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Yeah.
(中文): 是的。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: But a lot of them aren't, right?
(中文): 但其中很多都不是，对吧？

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Right. Mm-hmm.
(中文): 好的。嗯。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: So the best founders and the best sales execs and the best SDRs will spend two hours researching an email. "Okay, who exactly at IBM should I reach out to? Who else exactly is a competitor that's using them? Exactly what was the ROI?" They'll give you a perfect story. If you get the world's best story, here's your competitor, here's how they use it, here's exactly when they bought, here's the ROI, here's the case study, that's a great email. How many 21-year-old SDRs do that? No, they use an automation tool, whether it's Outreach or Gong or Salesloft or MixMax or an AI-based, but they do no work. It's not going to be that great. It's not going to be that great. So that's why people get a little confused. The bar for good enough for AI GTM, it's not as high as we think. It's just a facsimile of your best person reproduced as best we can. It's going to beat your mid-pack person. It's going to beat the person that literally knows nothing about your product.
(中文): 因此，最优秀的创始人、最出色的销售主管以及最顶尖的销售开发代表会花上两个小时来研究一封邮件。"那么，我到底应该联系IBM的哪一位？还有哪些竞争对手正在使用他们的产品？具体的投资回报率是多少？"他们会为你呈现一个完美的故事。如果你获得了世界上最棒的故事——这是你的竞争对手，他们是这样使用的，他们购买的具体时间点，这是投资回报率，这是案例研究——那就是一封出色的邮件。有多少21岁的销售开发代表会这么做呢？不，他们会使用自动化工具，无论是Outreach、Gong、Salesloft、MixMax，还是基于人工智能的工具，但他们不做任何实质性的工作。那样做不会有多出色，真的不会有多出色。所以这就是为什么人们会感到有些困惑。对于人工智能产品上市来说，"足够好"的标准并没有我们想象的那么高。它只是尽可能复制你最佳员工的一个翻版。它会胜过你团队中的中等水平者，也会胜过那些对你的产品一无所知的人。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Is this an opportunity for humans to continue to thrive, this layer of much better emails? This came up when we had Jen Abel on the podcast. I asked her, "What tools do you use? What do you use?" She's like, "Nothing. I just write it out artisanally." And it works really well because everyone's sending AI emails. Is this just where go-to-market salespeople still can exist, this much better email, or is that also going to go away?
(中文): 这是否意味着人类仍有机会继续蓬勃发展，即通过这层质量更高的电子邮件？这个问题是在我们邀请珍·阿贝尔上播客时提出的。我问她：“你使用什么工具？你用什么？”她回答说：“什么都不用。我只是像手工艺人一样亲手写出来。”而且效果非常好，因为大家都在发送AI生成的邮件。这是否意味着市场销售人员仍能凭借这种更优质的邮件生存下去，还是说连这一点也会消失？

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Look, if you have a high-performing human team hunting high dollar value logos, and this is classic stuff, Lenny and I and Jen are in a conference room, we put a whiteboard of the 50 best folks that we want to sponsor Lenny's podcast. There's only 50 and we write Notion and we write Linear and we write Replit. There's only 50. And we're all trying to sell them these new sponsorships. They're half a million bucks for two years. Take it or leave it. We divide them up and we say, "Lenny's best at this, Jason's best as Jen," and we each take 15 or 17. Dude, no need for AI there, is there? Agreed. No need for AI today.
(中文): 听着，如果你有一支高效的人力团队专门负责争取高价值品牌合作，这可是经典操作——我和Lenny还有Jen在会议室里，白板上列出了我们想为Lenny的播客争取的50家顶级赞助商。就这50家，我们写上Notion、Linear、Replit这些名字。只有50家。我们都在努力向他们推销这些新的赞助方案，两年合约价值五十万美元，接不接受随你。我们分配任务，说“Lenny擅长这个，Jason和Jen配合最佳”，然后每人负责15到17家。兄弟，这哪里需要人工智能？同意吧，目前确实用不着AI。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Because ROI is really high.
(中文): 因为投资回报率确实很高。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Yeah, and we're great. The three of us, we're different. The three of us are really different. It's going to crush and we don't need any... Maybe one of us will take our emails and run it through Claude real quick just to make it better. Or what I do is I do it for more research. I write the world's best email and then I say, "Claude, how could I make this better?" Do a little research, it will still be better. So that's an AI boost Jen should be doing. I love Jen, but she should at least be making it better. But for our 45, 50 best ones, we don't need it. What if it's 5,000? Her approach just doesn't work. So yes, a lot of the stuff we're talking about lends itself to higher-volume sales, but as everyone gets bigger, it's all higher volume. There's just so much volume as you scale. Yes, if you're tiny and you have three prospects and you're just getting into Y Combinator, maybe you don't need these tools, but we graduate out of that more quickly. And the bespoke thing for Jen, I think, will work for high dollar value enterprise, but outside of that, I don't know, man. You just can't touch enough people. Humans can't touch enough people. And humans don't want to do the work. They don't want to talk to the mediocre leads. I'll tell you an example. When I was in London, I wanted to buy a $10,000 product and I'm literally in London and we're doing SaaS one. I don't have any time. I get confused with the time zones, Lenny. I don't know if you do. I don't even know what time it is in the Bay Area. So I just emailed this rep, it's the end of the year. I'm like, "Just send me the contract. I want to buy it." But I have two questions. I have two questions I want answered. And I told them these two questions and they weren't even about price. Took him three days to get back to me and he introduced me to someone else on his team. It wasn't worth his time. 10 grand wasn't enough because there's not enough commission for him. So he introduced someone else to me and the other guy said, "I can't answer your questions unless you'll get on the phone." And I said, "I'm in London. I'm traveling." Ordinarily, I would've ended this, but it's a journey. I'm like, "If you answer my two questions, I will buy your product for 10K." He's like, "I need to get on the phone." AI's better than that. This is not Jen's and the whiteboard's thing of doing it. Even if Jen's process is right, AI can fill all the gaps. What about all the sponsors, the leads we didn't follow up with that we got a 70% response rate? The Jens are a diamond in the rough, whatever the expression is. There's not that many of them. There's not that many of them. I love her and I love what she says and I agree with 99% of it, but here's a related point. Most of us don't have the hottest brands and we don't have the most elite CROs running them, so we end up settling for not the best sales team. That's the truth. 99% of the best sales reps want to work just with the hottest brands. And the minute your star fades just a little bit, they immediately want to jump to the next one. There's a lot of reasons why. Bear in mind, 99% of the world cannot attract a team of Jens for better. It's just practical. Even I can't. Lenny, you're so great, but even a lot of folks that would want to go work for you if you wanted to hire someone, they'd be like, "Well, I love the... But what do I have to do? I've got to sell newsletter spon... No, no, no, no, No, no, no, no. I want to be CRO at Lovable. I love Lenny, but is that really going to get me there?" Right?
(中文): 是的，我们很出色。我们三个，我们各不相同。我们三个真的非常不同。这会带来巨大压力，而我们不需要任何……或许我们中有人会把自己的邮件快速过一遍Claude来优化它。或者像我这样，为了更深入研究而操作。我写出全世界最棒的邮件，然后问"Claude，我该如何改进它？"稍作研究，结果总会更好。所以这是珍应该做的AI辅助工作。我爱珍，但她至少应该让邮件变得更好。不过对于我们那45、50封最优质的邮件，我们并不需要这种辅助。但如果是5000封呢？她的方法就行不通了。所以没错，我们讨论的很多内容确实适用于更高销量的场景，但随着每个人规模扩大，都会面临高销量问题。规模扩张时业务量就是如此庞大。是的，如果你规模很小，只有三个潜在客户，刚进入Y Combinator，或许你不需要这些工具，但我们脱离那个阶段的速度更快。至于珍那种定制化方式，我认为在高价值企业级销售中会有效，但除此之外，我就不确定了。你根本无法触达足够多的人。人类无法触达足够多的人。而且人类也不愿意做这些工作。他们不想和那些平庸的潜在客户交谈。我给你举个例子。我在伦敦时想购买一件1万美元的产品，当时我就在伦敦处理SaaS业务。我根本没有时间。时区问题让我很困惑，莱尼。不知道你是否会这样。我甚至不知道湾区现在是几点。所以我在年底直接给销售代表发了邮件，我说"直接把合同发给我，我想购买。"但我有两个问题需要解答。我提出了这两个问题，甚至都不是关于价格的。他花了三天才回复我，还把我介绍给了团队里的另一个人。他觉得不值得花时间。1万美元对他来说佣金不够高。所以他把我转给了另一个人，那个人说"除非你愿意通电话，否则我无法回答你的问题。"我说"我在伦敦，正在旅行。"通常这种情况下我会直接放弃，但这次是个特例。我说"只要你回答我这两个问题，我就花1万美元买你们的产品。"他却说"我需要通电话。"AI比这强多了。这不是珍和白板上那种工作方式能解决的。即使珍的流程正确，AI也能填补所有空白。那些我们获得70%回复率却未跟进的主办方和潜在客户怎么办？珍这样的人才是未经雕琢的钻石，不管这个说法是否准确。这样的人并不多。真的不多。我爱她，也赞同她说的99%的内容，但这里有个相关观点：我们大多数人都没有最热门的品牌，也没有最顶尖的首席营收官在运营，所以最终只能接受并非最优秀的销售团队。这就是现实。99%的优秀销售代表只想和最热门的品牌合作。一旦你的明星光环稍有黯淡，他们立刻就想跳槽到下一个热门品牌。这背后有很多原因。请记住，世界上99%的公司都无法吸引像珍这样的团队。这很现实。连我都做不到。莱尼，你非常出色，但即使有很多人想为你工作，如果你要招聘，他们也会想"我很喜欢……但我具体要做什么？是要销售新闻通讯赞助……不不不不不。我想成为Lovable的首席营收官。我喜欢莱尼，但这真的能帮我实现目标吗？"对吧？

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Yeah.
(中文): 是的。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: AI can beat those. AI can beat those. But AI can't beat the enterprise thing. I have no idea how AI is going to do in person sales. Someone smarter than me is going to have to answer that. You have such a huge audience, Lenny, but I still think most of your folks are in tech and doing tech sales. Tech is the largest segment of our economy and growing. So for the most part, these tools will work for tech sales. Tech sales is over the Zoom, over the phone, over email. We should knock on more doors. We should do more in person. All the data I've ever collected shows everything closes at a higher rate if you go in person. It's just not. But in tech, it's basically as much automation as we can get away with in GTM.
(中文): AI可以战胜那些。AI可以战胜那些。但AI无法战胜企业级销售这件事。我不知道AI在面对面销售中会表现如何。这需要比我更聪明的人来回答。Lenny，你的受众群体非常庞大，但我仍然认为你的大部分听众都身处科技行业，从事科技销售。科技是我们经济中最大且仍在增长的板块。因此，这些工具在大多数情况下适用于科技销售。科技销售主要通过Zoom、电话和邮件进行。我们应该更多地敲门拜访。我们应该更多地面对面交流。我收集的所有数据都表明，面对面交流能带来更高的成交率。只是现在情况并非如此。但在科技领域，我们的市场进入策略基本上能实现多大程度的自动化，就会追求多大程度的自动化。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: What I think might be helpful is just let me zoom out for a second and describe what you've gone through here. I love this visual you had of the desks of the sales folks in your office where you had inbound SDRs, you had outbound SDRs, maybe a support person.
(中文): 我认为可能有帮助的是，让我先退一步，描述一下你在这里经历的情况。我很喜欢你提到的办公室销售团队工位的画面：既有负责入站线索的销售开发代表，也有负责出站线索的销售开发代表，可能还有支持人员。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: And three or four AEs, account executives.
(中文): 以及三到四位客户主管。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Okay. And three or four AEs who take these leads and then close the deal. And so now, just instead of humans, there's an agent doing each of these jobs.
(中文): 好的。那么，现在有三四位客户经理负责跟进这些潜在客户并最终达成交易。而现在，只是将原本由人类完成的工作，改由智能代理来执行每一项任务。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Yes.
(中文): 是的。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: They have this outbound agent that's just sending emails, trying to find potential leads. An inbound agent that's talking to people that are interested, trying to get them more excited. And then is there an AE agent or... I forget how that works.
(中文): 他们有一个外呼代理，专门发送邮件，试图寻找潜在客户线索。还有一个内呼代理，负责与感兴趣的人交谈，努力让他们更加兴奋。那么，有没有一个客户经理代理或者……我忘记具体是怎么运作的了。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: No, that's what I'm still learning. We have one full-time AE plus 20% of Amelia's time, so it's 1.2, doing what five or six AEs do.
(中文): 不，这正是我还在学习的地方。我们有一位全职客户执行，加上艾米莉亚20%的时间投入，所以相当于1.2个人力，却承担了五到六位客户执行的工作量。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: I see. So basically-
(中文): 我明白了。那么基本上——

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: No SDR, BDRs.
(中文): 没有SDR，BDR。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Got it. So basically all the top of funnels is AI.
(中文): 明白了。那么基本上所有漏斗的顶端都是人工智能。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Yes.
(中文): 是的。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: And there's one human now that takes all the great stuff and just closes the deals, negotiates pricing, things like that.
(中文): 现在有一个人专门负责整合所有优质资源，敲定交易，协商价格等等。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Yeah. Maybe 1.2 just to say it, but yeah, let's call it 1.2.
(中文): 是的。也许就说是1.2吧，不过，好吧，我们就定为1.2。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Yeah. So that's where I wanted to go. So Amelia, so that feels really important. Just somebody, not necessarily full-time, but just staying on top of these agents, watching the emails, making sure quality's high, making sure they're running correctly. Talk about just how important that part is to this whole operation.
(中文): 是的。这正是我想探讨的方向。所以艾米莉亚，这部分确实至关重要。就是需要有专人，不一定全职，但能持续跟进这些代理，监控邮件往来，确保质量达标，保证它们正常运行。谈谈这一环节对整个运营的重要性吧。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: It's critical. It's critical. And people are posting on LinkedIn that they want to hire these GTM engineers or... I don't think that role exists today. I worry when I see these roles. I think today, and listen, if we get together in 18 months, we'll update this because the world's changing so fast. I think today, 95% of 100, you've got to promote someone internally. It's got to be a nerd, someone that likes marketing and sales and is quant. A lot of B2C people are frankly good at this stuff because in B2C, sales and marketing are kind of the same thing. But someone that's a nerd that loves to sit in front of data for a couple hours a day and route data and manage these agents. And they could come out of product, they could come out of marketing, but maybe they could come out of RevOps, but they better be nerdy. Odds, they come out of regular sales approach zero. So I would find someone on my team that raises their hand and says, "I've already done this. I've already written 10 apps in Replit and I love Vercel and I did this and I've already tried these ones on my own. Can I please manage these for you?" And then have them be your chief orchestration officer. But it is a new skillset. It really is. And ultimately, finding someone that's going to spend an hour to two a day to manage these agents is the new frontier for us to figure out. They operate autonomously, but not without constant oversight and iteration. That's the confusing part. And if you just buy one of these products and disappear, you will have zero ROI. So maybe too long of an answer, but that's critical. And I just think, unfortunately, you have to grow this resource at home today. You have to. Even between Vercel that basically grew the resource at home. We're not all Vercel, but I just haven't seen it. Everyone's hosting for this job, but we need veterans. We don't have veterans yet. And going back earlier in the conversation, if that is you, you're going to be super employable next year. You're going to have so many job offers, you're not going to know what to... You're going to have to beat them off.
(中文): 这至关重要。这至关重要。我看到有人在领英上发帖说要招聘这类市场拓展工程师，或者说……我认为目前这个职位并不存在。看到这些招聘时我很担忧。我认为目前，听我说，如果我们18个月后再聚，我们会更新这个观点，因为世界变化太快。我认为目前，百分之九十五的情况下，你必须从内部提拔。这个人必须是个技术迷，一个热爱营销和销售、擅长量化分析的人。说实话，很多B2C领域的人擅长这个，因为在B2C领域，销售和营销几乎是同一回事。但这个人必须是个技术迷，愿意每天花几小时坐在数据前，梳理数据、管理这些智能体。他们可能来自产品部门，可能来自营销部门，也可能来自营收运营部门，但他们最好是个技术迷。从传统销售岗位转来的概率几乎为零。所以我会在团队里找那个主动举手说："我已经做过这些了。我已在Replit上写了10个应用，我热爱Vercel，我还自己尝试过这些工具。能让我来帮你管理吗？"的人，然后让他们担任你的首席协调官。但这确实是全新的技能组合。真的。归根结底，找到一个愿意每天花一两小时管理这些智能体的人，是我们需要探索的新领域。它们能自主运行，但离不开持续的监督和迭代优化。这正是令人困惑之处。如果你只是购买这类产品就撒手不管，投资回报率将为零。或许这个回答太长了，但这确实至关重要。我只是认为，遗憾的是，目前你必须自己培养这种人才。必须如此。就连Vercel基本上也是内部培养出这种人才的。我们不是Vercel，但我确实没见到现成的人才。所有人都在为这个职位发愁，但我们需要的是经验丰富的老手。而我们现在还没有这样的老手。回到早先的讨论，如果你正是这样的人才，明年你会变得极具就业竞争力。你会收到无数工作邀约，多到不知如何抉择……你需要推开那些蜂拥而至的机会。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: And when you think of... Is Amelia, would you describe her as a go to-market engineer or is that a different role, would you call her chief AE officer?
(中文): 那么当你想到……艾米莉亚时，你会将她描述为市场推广工程师吗？还是说那是另一个职位，你会称她为首席客户拓展官吗？

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: I would say now, yeah.
(中文): 我现在会说，是的。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Okay, cool.
(中文): 好的，明白了。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: But she knows the product's cold. Cold. She knows how all the quirks work, how all the agents work. And this is a complicated issue, but an interesting one. If you're running multiple agents, okay, someone's got to segment which of the base the agents are working with, or they're going to have tons of conflict. You need someone smart enough and any really nerdy demand gen marketer that loves data can do this, but you've got to segment your base. Otherwise, it just becomes a mess. There are no people on X and the internet talk about these master agents that can manage agents that can manage agents. We're not there yet, okay? Maybe. I'm excited for it, but we're not there yet. So just even figuring out how to segment your base so you can do inbound, retargeting, remarketing, new marketing. So that is complicated. But most badass marketers can't understand that. They're already doing A/B testing, segmenting their bases. This is not new, is it?
(中文): 但她清楚产品是冰冷的。冰冷的。她了解所有独特之处如何运作，所有代理如何工作。这是个复杂的问题，但也很有趣。如果你在运行多个代理，好吧，必须有人来划分这些代理各自处理哪些基础数据，否则会产生大量冲突。你需要足够聪明的人，任何一个真正痴迷数据的书呆子型需求生成营销人员都能做到，但你必须细分你的基础数据。否则，一切就会变得一团糟。在X平台和互联网上，没有人讨论那些能管理代理的超级代理，我们还没到那一步，对吧？也许吧。我对此感到兴奋，但我们还没到那一步。所以，光是搞清楚如何细分你的基础数据，以便进行入站营销、重定向、再营销和新营销，就已经很复杂了。但大多数顶尖营销人员都明白这一点。他们已经在做A/B测试，细分他们的基础数据了。这并不新鲜，对吧？

[Lenny Rachitsky]: No.
(中文): 不。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: No. Yeah.
(中文): 不。是的。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Yeah.
(中文): 是的。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: But turning it on with zero work is a F. It's just no chance.
(中文): 但零工作量启动是F。这根本不可能。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: This episode is brought to you by Datadog, now home to Eppo, the leading experimentation and feature flagging platform. Product managers at the world's best companies use Datadog. The same platform their engineers rely on every day to connect product insights to product issues like bugs, UX friction, and business impact. It starts with product analytics, where PMs can watch replays, review funnels, dive into retention, and explore their growth metrics. Where other tools stop, Datadog goes even further. It helps you actually diagnose the impact of funnel drop-offs and bugs and UX friction. Once you know where to focus, experiments prove what works. I saw this firsthand when I was at Airbnb where our experimentation platform was critical for analyzing what worked and where things went wrong. And the same team that built experimentation at Airbnb built Eppo. Datadog then lets you go beyond the numbers with session replay. Watch exactly how users interact with heat maps and scroll maps to truly understand their behavior. And all of this is powered by feature flags that are tied to real-time data so that you can roll out safely, target precisely and learn continuously. Datadog is more than engineering metrics. It's where great product teams learn faster, fix smarter, and ship with confidence. Request a demo at datadoghq.com/lenny. That's datadoghq.com/lenny. I'm looking back at some notes I took as you were talking of just advice for each function almost of how to be successful in this future that you're seeing. So I'll try to summarize briefly. So your advice for salespeople is use the agents, build one yourself, try to train it, help it run, run alongside you so that you understand these tools and be the person within the sales organization.
(中文): 本期节目由Datadog赞助播出，Datadog现已整合领先的实验与功能开关平台Eppo。全球顶尖企业的产品经理都在使用Datadog——这个工程师们日常依赖的同一平台，能够将产品洞察与产品问题（如程序缺陷、用户体验摩擦及业务影响）关联起来。它始于产品分析功能：产品经理可通过回放观察用户操作、分析转化漏斗、深入探究用户留存、探索增长指标。当其他工具止步时，Datadog更进一步，助您精准诊断漏斗流失、程序缺陷与用户体验摩擦的实际影响。明确聚焦方向后，实验将验证有效方案。我在Airbnb任职期间曾亲身体验：实验平台对分析成功要素与问题症结至关重要。而打造Airbnb实验平台的团队正是Eppo的创建者。Datadog还通过会话回放功能带您超越数据表象——借助热力图与滚动图直观观察用户交互行为，真正理解用户习惯。所有这些功能都由关联实时数据的功能开关驱动，助您安全部署、精准定向、持续学习。Datadog不仅是工程指标平台，更是卓越产品团队加速学习、智能修复、自信交付的基石。欢迎访问datadoghq.com/lenny申请演示。网址是datadoghq.com/lenny。我正在回顾您谈话时做的笔记，其中几乎涵盖了每个职能部门如何在这个您所预见的未来中取得成功的建议。我试着简要总结一下：您对销售人员的建议是善用智能代理工具，尝试自主构建并训练它，协助其运行，让工具与您协同工作，从而深入理解这些技术，成为销售团队中精通智能工具的先行者。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: For leadership, I advise that.
(中文): 对于领导力，我建议如下。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: For leaders.
(中文): 致领导者。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: I don't know that if your average SDR or junior salesperson is going to get budget for their own agent. If they do run with it. The problem, Lenny, is that all these agents that work today, they have forward deployed engineers, they have training. So they're all like 50 grand and up. 50 grand, 80 grand. I mean, people pay more, don't get me wrong. But kind of the entry level point for these is like 50 grand plus 25K for the FDE or 75. Even Clay I think starts at 100K a year. So if you're a bigger organization, that's cheaper than a human, right? It's a tall. But there are no $99 a month products, which has a lot of it. They're trying and I think it's going to come. They don't auto train yet particularly well. And so I don't know that junior folks are going to have access to 100K budget, unfortunately. So that advice is for the VPs, the folks that are worried. A lot of them are worried that I'm obsolete, that I'm obsolete, that I'm not going to get that role at Vercel or OpenAI. So keep going. The advice for the junior folks is to embrace it. Whatever tools your organization is using, become the best person at working with that agent and you'll automatically get more efficient. Yeah. Is it annoying that you walk into work and the agent set up four calls for you and maybe you only wanted to do two of them? Embrace it. Embrace it because you'll be twice as productive. I was literally talking yesterday. There's a company I'm on the board of called owner.com, which is kind of like AI for restaurants are crossing 100 million and revenue going really quickly. It's got a hundred folks on the sales team Kyle does. With AI, he's targeting three to five million in revenue per rep. Three to five million. Honestly, if this was three or four years ago for a similar company, it would be three to 500K. That's an order of magnitude more efficiency. Still a hundred reps, right? A hundred reps. He's going to need more to hit the number for next year, but three to five million per rep. So if you're that guy that can work with those tools, you become more valuable. But if you fight it, if you don't want to do that extra meeting, if you fight it, there's another tool we use for RevOps. There's two we use. One's called Momentum. One's called Attention. They're both great. They're very similar. And what it does is every single thing a human does is automatically tracked in your CRM instantly, real time. There have been tools that have done some of this before, but literally everything. And when we rolled it out and it happened with a few other folks I know, one of the folks on that old team quit that day. Quit the day we rolled out the AI RevOps. You know why? Hadn't done anything in 30 days. The gig was up.
(中文): 我不确定普通的销售开发代表或初级销售人员能否为自己的智能体申请到预算。如果他们真的尝试使用的话。问题是，莱尼，目前市面上所有能正常工作的智能体都需要配备前置部署工程师和培训支持。所以它们的起步价基本都在五万美元以上，五万、八万不等。当然也有人支付更高费用，这点毋庸置疑。但这类产品的入门门槛大约是五万美元，加上前置部署工程师的两万五，总计七万五。就连克莱的产品我认为起价也要每年十万美元。所以对大型企业来说，这比人力成本更划算，对吧？这是个可观的数字。但目前还没有月费99美元的产品，这很大程度上制约了普及。虽然厂商正在朝这个方向努力，我认为低价方案终会出现。当前这些智能体的自动训练功能还不够完善。因此恐怕初级员工很难获得十万美元的预算支持。所以我的建议是针对副总裁级别、那些感到焦虑的管理者。他们很多人担心自己会被淘汰，担心无法在Vercel或OpenAI获得职位。请继续努力。对于初级员工的建议则是：拥抱变革。无论公司采用什么工具，努力成为最擅长运用该智能体的人，你的工作效率自然会提升。是的，当你走进办公室发现智能体安排了四场会议，而你原本只想参加其中两场时，这确实令人烦恼——但请接受它。接受它，因为你的工作效率将翻倍。昨天我正好在讨论这个话题：我担任董事的owner.com公司（一家为餐厅提供人工智能服务的公司）营收正快速突破一亿美元，其销售团队由凯尔领导的百人组成。借助人工智能，他的目标是让每位销售代表创造三到五百万美元营收。说实话，如果换作三四年前的同类型公司，这个数字只会是三十到五十万美元。这是数量级的效率提升。团队规模不变，还是百名销售代表。虽然明年要实现目标需要更多人，但人均三到五百万美元的产出非常惊人。所以，如果你能熟练运用这些工具，你的价值就会提升。但如果你抗拒变革，不愿参加额外会议——我们RevOps部门使用的工具就是例证。我们采用两款工具：Momentum和Attention，两者都很出色且功能相似。它们能实时自动追踪员工在客户关系管理系统中的每一个操作。虽然以往也有部分类似功能的工具，但现在是真正意义上的全流程覆盖。当我们推行这套系统时（我认识的其他团队也发生过类似情况），有位老团队成员当天就辞职了——就在我们启动AI RevOps系统那天。知道原因吗？系统显示他三十天内没有任何工作记录。真相大白，他再也无法浑水摸鱼了。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Oh, wow.
(中文): 哦，哇。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Every day he would show up to our standup and he said, "Yeah, I'm doing outbound and I'm really working on that deal with Vercel and nothing would close." And then we said, "Oh," and he quit that day. So my point is he didn't lean into it, right? Lean into it. Now you're going to have total transparency on your day. Granola is a side example for everything, but AI is going to track everything you do. If you want to fight it, if you want to fight the future, good luck to you, but embrace it and you will leap ahead of your peers that aren't embracing this. Embrace all the transparency, all the leads, all the work it makes you do, because you can't close 10 times as much doing the same amount of work, can you?
(中文): 每天他都会出现在我们的站会上说："是的，我正在做外联工作，我真的很努力在推进与Vercel的那笔交易，但就是谈不成。"然后我们说："哦，"结果他当天就辞职了。所以我的意思是，他没有真正投入进去，对吧？要全心投入。现在，你的一天将完全透明化。格兰诺拉麦片只是万事万物中的一个侧面例子，但人工智能将会追踪你做的每一件事。如果你想对抗它，如果你想对抗未来，祝你好运，但拥抱它，你就会超越那些不接纳这一切的同龄人。拥抱所有的透明度，所有的潜在客户，所有它促使你完成的工作，因为你不可能用同样的工作量完成十倍于现在的业绩，不是吗？

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Nope.
(中文): 不是。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: We do more work with AI. I'm working the hardest I've ever worked. With all these agents and all the output they create, and Amelia does a lot of it, but even I am working the hardest, but it's better, but it's not less work. It's more work. The agents are so productive, you have to keep up. So sorry to interrupt. For the managers, buy an agent, deploy it yourself. Don't have someone else do it. Do everything from training to ingestion to orchestration. And those terms will be less scary to you. For the junior folks, be the guy, the gal, the person that loves these tools and that is the first person to embrace whatever it is. Don't fight it.
(中文): 我们与人工智能合作得更多了。我正经历着前所未有的高强度工作。尽管有这么多智能体以及它们产生的所有输出，阿米莉亚承担了其中很大一部分，但就连我也在加倍努力，情况确实有所改善，但工作量并未减少，反而增加了。这些智能体的生产力极高，你必须跟上节奏。很抱歉打断一下。对于管理者们，请购买一个智能体，亲自部署它。不要让别人代劳。从训练到数据整合再到流程编排，全程亲力亲为。这样那些术语对你来说就不会那么可怕了。对于初级员工，要成为那个热爱这些工具的人，无论是什么新事物，都要成为第一个拥抱它的人。不要抗拒。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Awesome. Okay. For founders in startups, what I'm hearing is be that forward deployed engineer, have that person, that sales engineer that's sitting there helping companies. This is basically an opportunity to compete with bigger players where you're actually there helping them set things up. All the companies you mentioned, none of them are big companies. They're all startups, which is really interesting.
(中文): 很好。明白了。对于初创公司的创始人来说，我听到的建议是成为那种前置部署的工程师，拥有这样的人才，即销售工程师，他们坐在那里帮助客户公司。这基本上是一个与更大竞争对手较量的机会，因为你实际上是在现场帮助他们进行设置。你提到的所有公司，没有一家是大公司。它们都是初创企业，这真的很有趣。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: It is true. I will say it is working with Salesforce the way we are. It's the way I haven't worked with Salesforce since it was the first product I bought, I mean, 20 years ago, dude. When I bought Salesforce 20 years ago, I got everything that was hands-on. I bought two seats. I remember back in the day talking to my rep, I'm like, "Don't talk to me. You don't have time. You work at Salesforce. I'm buying two seats." It's like, "No, no, no. This is what we do. I'm here for you. I'm going to help you get your app on the app exchange. We're going to do all of it." And that went away. It's back. And Mark's got 2,000 folks doing this at Salesforce now. So we have a forward deployed engineer. I'm not even sure it makes economic sense. And maybe in two years, someone like you or I would not get an FDE, but the big companies are figuring it out. But yes, pick a vendor that will make you a success with an FDE. And people throw this term out, but again, it's just someone that's going to make sure you get trained and onboarded with your product for real. But yeah, so startups have a motivation to do this in a way that maybe some of the incumbents really are still figuring out, right?
(中文): 确实如此。我会说，我们目前与Salesforce的合作方式就是这样。这是我自20年前首次购买Salesforce产品以来，从未有过的合作体验，老兄。20年前我购买Salesforce时，所有事情都得亲力亲为。我当时买了两个用户席位。记得那时候我跟销售代表说：“别跟我多聊，你没时间。你在Salesforce工作，我只是买两个席位而已。”他却回答：“不不不，这就是我们的工作。我在这儿就是为您服务的。我会帮您把应用上架到应用商店，我们会全程协助。”但后来这种服务消失了。现在它又回来了。马克现在在Salesforce安排了2000名员工专门做这件事。所以我们配备了一位前线部署工程师。我甚至不确定这在经济上是否划算。也许两年后，像你我这样的人可能就享受不到前线部署工程师服务了，但大公司正在逐步落实这种模式。总之，一定要选择能通过前线部署工程师助您成功的供应商。虽然人们常把这个术语挂在嘴边，但说到底，就是确保您能获得实实在在的产品培训和上手支持。不过话说回来，初创公司在这方面有动力去推进，而一些老牌企业可能还在摸索阶段，对吧？

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Which is a big opportunity for startups to actually do this. And this actually resonates very closely to what Jen suggested for startups, which is sell services initially, just like do work for them, solve their problem, not with software to get things started, to grow that into a massive contract with them that is software.
(中文): 这对初创企业来说是一个巨大的机遇，可以真正实践这一点。这与Jen为初创企业提出的建议高度契合，即最初销售服务，就像为他们工作一样，解决他们的问题，而不是一开始就依赖软件来启动业务，从而逐步发展成一份涉及软件的大型合同。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: You mean being landed, expand, start with a smaller deal and grow it?
(中文): 你的意思是先站稳脚跟，然后扩张，从一笔小交易开始，再逐步做大？

[Lenny Rachitsky]: No, a person sitting there doing this work with them, essentially what you're describing. Don't just like, "We have software, go try using it." It's like we will have someone on our team helping you figure this out and maybe there's not even software yet to do all these things, but we'll have them do it for you. And then the software will take on more and more of that work over time.
(中文): 不，我们会有团队成员坐在那里，与您一同完成这项工作，这基本上就是您所描述的情形。我们不会只是简单地说："我们有软件，您去试试看。"而是会有专人协助您解决这个问题，甚至可能目前还没有软件能完全处理所有这些事务，但我们会安排人员为您代劳。随着时间的推移，软件将逐步承担越来越多的工作。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: I think that's always been great advice. And startups have always been great at this. In the early days, the CEO does it is doing support and CEO's onboarding you. I think what's different today is the agent will fail without training and onboarding this product. It will fail. It will never work. So it becomes an imperative if you want to win. This term's been bandied about too much, but you need a team of humans, we can call them forward deployed engineers that make 100% sure that when the agent is turned on, it's awesome. That's your job as a founder. Make sure it's awesome. Versus in the old days, even when I built one of the first e-signature services that was so easy to use, we'd have some customers take them two years to go live, big customers. That's just not okay in the age of AI. Right?
(中文): 我认为这向来是极佳的建议。初创公司在这方面也一直做得很好。早期阶段，CEO会亲自处理客户支持，甚至参与新员工的入职培训。我认为如今的不同之处在于，如果不经过培训和产品熟悉过程，智能代理将无法运作。它必定会失败，永远无法正常工作。因此，若想取得成功，这已成为一项必要条件。虽然"前向部署工程师"这个说法近来被过度使用，但你的确需要一支由人类组成的团队——我们可以称之为前向部署工程师——来确保当智能代理启动时，其表现堪称卓越。这就是作为创始人的职责所在：务必让它表现出色。相比之下，在过去，即便是我打造了当时最易用的电子签名服务之一，我们的一些大客户仍可能耗时两年才能正式投入使用。但在人工智能时代，这种情况是绝不可接受的。对吧？

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Yeah. And these forward deployed engineers, is that just another name for sales engineer or is that a different sort of background?
(中文): 是的。那么这些前置部署工程师，这只是销售工程师的另一种称呼，还是他们拥有不同的背景？

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: It can be. And I think all this nomenclature is confusing, man. All this orchestration and ingestion. I think Palantir is obviously the single most successful public B2B company at the moment. Maybe Databricks and a few others will beat them in the next wave of IPOs, but their idea for forward deployed engineers is similar, but these are nine figure deals. Most of us aren't doing $100 million deals. So the idea that you'll have Garry Tan and an army of folks out in the office for six months getting the software to work, that sort of inspires the idea, but it's really, sure, it could be a sales engineer or solution architect. But the difference is the SEs that a lot of us worked with in the days were resources. And often, there was also a classic resource of like eight sales reps to one SE. So the eight reps, there'd be a pod and one SE would be responsible and you'd kind of have to fight to get Jason or Lenny's time to help the eight reps. This is inverted. The FDE is number one job is to make the customer a success. Okay? I was literally the other day doing a presentation in an AI leader that closed a $3 million deal. The FDE did it all himself. Sales wasn't even involved in the deal. They went on site, they got the deployment going, they tuned it everything. All sales did was manage it through the procurement process. Okay? That's pretty different than a guy answering some questions for the humans. So it is a combination of customer success and SE or whatever, but it is really... I mean, frankly, it's just being a classic consultant that gets the product done on day one, on day one. That's the difference is that when you go live, it works. When you go live, it works. And it's a fancy name for a bunch of folks on your team that when it goes live, the AI agent actually works. So you have 100% success rate instead of like the 5% rate of 2024. So those people, but they do need to be technical. I don't know if they need to be engineers. It can really vary based on... I love it when they're like mediocre engineers that are in love with the product. That's my favorite type of FDE. They don't really want to code much anymore, but they did code and they just love your product. But I don't think it can be someone with no product chops, but all different folks can work, but they've got to know the product cold. But yeah, startups, I mean, the term is thrown around. You need four folks that will just make sure that on go live, the product works, your agentic product works. That's what you need.
(中文): 可能是这样。我觉得所有这些术语都很令人困惑，伙计。所有这些编排和摄取的概念。我认为Palantir显然是当前最成功的B2B上市公司。也许Databricks和其他几家公司会在下一波IPO中超越他们，但他们关于前置部署工程师的理念是相似的，不过这些都是九位数的交易。我们大多数人做的都不是一亿美元的交易。所以那种让Garry Tan和一群人驻扎在客户办公室六个月、确保软件正常运作的想法，确实能激发灵感，但这实际上——当然——可能就是个销售工程师或解决方案架构师的角色。但区别在于，我们过去合作过的很多销售工程师只是资源。而且通常存在典型的资源分配比例，比如八个销售代表配一个销售工程师。所以这八个销售代表组成一个小组，由一个销售工程师负责，你得费尽心思才能争取到Jason或Lenny的时间来帮助这八个销售代表。现在这种情况被颠覆了。前置部署工程师的首要任务是确保客户成功。明白吗？就在前几天，我还在给一位AI领域的高管做演示，他刚签下一笔300万美元的交易。那位前置部署工程师全程独立完成。销售团队甚至没有参与交易。他们现场部署、调试、搞定一切。销售团队只负责走采购流程。明白吗？这和那种只是回答些问题的人截然不同。所以这是客户成功和销售工程师角色的结合，或者随便叫什么，但这实际上……坦率地说，这就是个典型的顾问角色，从第一天起就确保产品落地，从第一天起。区别在于产品上线时就能正常运行。产品上线时就能正常运行。这只是个花哨的名称，指的是团队中那些确保AI代理上线时真正能工作的人。这样你就能实现100%的成功率，而不是像2024年那样只有5%。所以这些人确实需要懂技术。我不确定他们是否必须是工程师。这真的因情况而异……我最喜欢那种技术平平但热爱产品的工程师。那是我最欣赏的前置部署工程师类型。他们可能不再热衷编码，但有过编码经验，并且真心热爱你的产品。但我觉得不能是完全不懂产品的人，各种背景的人都可以胜任，但他们必须对产品了如指掌。不过对于初创公司来说，这个术语确实被滥用了。你需要四个人，确保产品上线时能正常运行，你的智能体产品能正常工作。这就是你需要的。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: I think what might be useful to close out this conversation is to go through what are the things that are changing, like maybe a handful of things that are changed that are now going to be different in the world of sales go-to-market, and what are a few things that are just going to stay the same?
(中文): 我认为，结束这次对话时，回顾一下哪些方面正在发生变化可能会很有帮助，比如列举几项在销售市场推广领域已经发生改变、未来将有所不同的事项，以及有哪些方面将保持不变？

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Yeah, let's go through it. Obviously, support is the first one to have changed. It's our obviously permanently changed with AI. Whatever vendor you look at, 50 to 80% of support is done by AI. And we don't always think about support as GTM, but it is. It's the start of a customer journey. It's very important to the customer journey. So if you're skeptical, go look at... Support has changed permanently. So that train's left the station. Really, as we record this, not much has changed in sales. I mean, I do think the stuff we've talked about is the bleeding edge. I do think the classic cadence-based SDR running campaigns through a tool, him or herself, will be mostly extinct with 12 months. There is no reason AI can't do a better job than that role. The classic qualifier, qualifying inbound leads, which is a crappy experience for customers, should be similarly extinct within mostly extinct in 12 months. The rest, we're going to wait and see. I think what we do know for reps, for sales reps, everyone wants to be even more efficient in the next 12 months. There's a lot of reasons people want to be... Again, at the bottom end, it's cost, it's profitability pressures. At the high end, it's cultural. We just don't want 200 reps running around Vercel or Replit that don't know what the product does. Just the company owner, three to five million per rep is a lot different than three to 500,000. So you have to adjust as a rep. Every AI leader can't hire enough reps like we talked about, but you're going to have to adjust to being geometrically, if not exponentially more productive with help from AI. So you have to embrace these tools for real. And a lot of folks, a lot of old school GTM leaders are like, "AI isn't going to hurt sales reps. It's just going to give them superpowers." The best ones, yes. The mediocre are just going to be more mediocre. So I think the AE is what we will always have salespeople, but being a people person is not enough anymore. You know how you can tell a mediocre salesperson, Lenny?
(中文): 好的，我们来梳理一下。显然，客服是第一个发生变化的领域。它已经因人工智能而发生了永久性的改变。无论你看哪家供应商，50%到80%的客服工作都由AI完成。我们并不总是把客服视为市场进入策略的一部分，但它确实是。它是客户旅程的起点，对客户旅程至关重要。所以如果你持怀疑态度，不妨去看看……客服已经永久改变了。这趟列车已经驶离站台。

实际上，在我们录制这段内容时，销售领域的变化还不大。我的意思是，我确实认为我们讨论的那些东西是最前沿的。我认为，那种经典的、基于固定节奏、通过工具运行营销活动的SDR（销售开发代表），他或她本人，在12个月内将基本消失。没有理由认为AI不能比这个角色做得更好。那种经典的、筛选入站线索的资格审核员（这对客户来说体验很差），同样应该在12个月内基本消失。其余的，我们拭目以待。

我认为，就销售代表而言，我们所知道的是，每个人都希望在接下来的12个月里效率更高。人们希望如此有很多原因……再说一次，在底层，是成本，是盈利压力。在高层，则是文化原因。我们就是不想让200个销售代表在Vercel或Replit这样的公司里跑来跑去，却对产品功能一无所知。公司所有者的情况也大不相同，每位代表创造300万到500万美元的收入，与30万到50万美元是天壤之别。所以作为销售代表，你必须调整自己。正如我们谈到的，每位AI领域的领导者都无法雇佣足够的销售代表，但你必须在AI的帮助下，将生产力几何级数（如果不是指数级）地提升。因此，你必须真正拥抱这些工具。

很多老派的市场进入策略领导者会说：“AI不会伤害销售代表，它只会赋予他们超能力。”对于最优秀的销售代表，确实如此。但对于平庸者，他们只会更加平庸。所以我认为，客户经理这个角色我们会一直保留，销售人员的岗位也会存在，但仅仅善于人际交往已经不够了。你知道如何辨别一个平庸的销售人员吗，莱尼？

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Yeah.
(中文): 是的。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: You ask them what they're really good at. I'm a people person, Lenny. You know how good I am, Lenny? I'm on text with 10 of my best customers. I'm a people person. What are the toughest technical objections you have at your product? What? What? They don't know, but they're a people person. This is like golf 3.0. It's not enough. It's insufficient. So people are becoming obsolete in sales. Field sales, no idea how AI is going to impact that if you're out in the field. I mean, the enterprise leaders are hiring more field salespeople than ever. Salesforce is hiring more than ever and knocking on doors still works, man. So don't know the answers there. But the office worker and the work from home worker, AI is going to take as much of your job or make you as much better as it can and you got to embrace it. So that's, I would say, from support to knocking on doors, we're going to go from 80% to 0% from AI.
(中文): 你问他们真正擅长什么。我是个人际交往高手，莱尼。你知道我有多厉害吗，莱尼？我正和10位顶级客户发信息沟通。我是个人际交往高手。你们产品遇到的最棘手技术异议是什么？什么？什么？他们不知道，但他们自称是人际交往高手。这就像是高尔夫3.0版本。这还不够。这是不足的。所以销售岗位上的人正在变得过时。实地销售，如果你在实地工作，根本不知道人工智能会如何影响这个领域。我是说，企业领导层正在招聘比以往更多的实地销售人员。Salesforce的招聘规模前所未有，而且上门推销依然有效，伙计。所以这方面还没有答案。但对于办公室员工和居家办公者，人工智能将尽可能多地取代你的工作，或让你变得更强，你必须接受它。所以，我想说，从客服支持到上门推销，我们将因人工智能从80%降至0%。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: What about phone calls?
(中文): 那电话呢？

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: It's a great question and we should have hit it. Obviously, there's plenty of robocall and regulatory issues around it. Certainly a lot of startups are breaking the rules anyway. I would say this, listen, there's phone calls and there's even SMS. There's limits to how much SMS you can automate. A lot of old school businesses don't even check emails. I mean, you're working on the shop floor. So those are unanswered questions. People are breaking the rules. OpenAI still breaks the rules. Now it's licensing Disney content. It used to just borrow Disney content. We will see. So I don't know the answers to that. I think in Europe, it'll certainly be much lower than in the US, but startups are going to push the limits. They're going to push the limits on what we can do with AI calls, AI enhanced, whether a human's kind of on the line, but AI is doing all the work, maybe that's legal, right? Getting more consent for SMS than we typically get. So to think that the typical barriers to robocalling and SMS that startups aren't going to bend the rules in the age of AI, I'm dubious. But it's a good question. It's harder to do. The one thing I will add is, and it's a good objection to all of this, and I'd love to get Jen's thoughts too. But if you talk to the startups you'd invest in, Lenny, fewer of them are good at outbound phone calls than you'd think. We had many of the heads of revenue at Rippling, speak at SaaStr, the old CRO worked on my team and others. They were late to develop cold calling because we never did it back in the day. The CRO was on my team. So we had to bring in someone that had worked with Sam Blond at Brex who had done it. It is a real art to pick up the phone and close business. It is a specialized skill. And so if that's your specialized skill and there's no way for AI to benefit, so be it. But I don't think for most tech calls that that is as impactful as we pretend it is. I don't think most of the startups you and I work with and most of the folks listen to this do not close the majority of their revenue with cold human cold calls. It is a craft that works, but man, you got to be good at it.
(中文): 这是一个很好的问题，我们本应深入探讨。显然，这其中涉及大量自动呼叫和相关监管问题。当然，许多初创公司已经在违规操作了。我想说的是，请注意，不仅有电话呼叫，甚至还有短信。短信的自动化发送是有限制的。很多传统企业甚至不看电子邮件。我的意思是，如果你在车间工作，那么这些方式可能都不适用。所以这些都是悬而未决的问题。人们正在打破规则。OpenAI 也在打破规则——以前它只是借用迪士尼的内容，现在却开始授权使用了。我们拭目以待。因此，我对此没有答案。我认为在欧洲，这类情况肯定会比美国少得多，但初创公司会不断试探边界。他们会不断探索人工智能呼叫的极限，无论是人工智能增强的呼叫，还是人类在线上但实际工作全由人工智能完成的情况——也许那样是合法的，对吧？获取比通常更多的短信发送许可。所以，如果认为在人工智能时代，初创公司不会在自动呼叫和短信方面规避规则，我对此表示怀疑。但这确实是个好问题，实际操作起来也更困难。

我想补充一点，这也是对所有这些问题的一个有力反驳，我也很想听听珍的看法。但如果你和你投资的初创公司聊聊，莱尼，你会发现擅长外呼电话的人比你想象的要少。我们曾邀请 Rippling 的几位营收负责人在 SaaStr 上发表演讲，其中一位前首席营收官曾在我的团队工作过。他们在开发陌生电话拜访方面起步较晚，因为我们过去从未这样做过。那位首席营收官曾是我的团队成员。因此，我们不得不引进一位曾在 Brex 与 Sam Blond 共事、有相关经验的人。拿起电话并达成交易是一门真正的艺术，是一项专业技能。所以，如果这是你的专业技能，而人工智能无法带来助益，那就顺其自然吧。但我认为，对于大多数科技行业的电话呼叫而言，其影响力并不像我们假装的那样大。我认为，你我合作的大多数初创公司以及大多数听众，并非主要通过人类陌生电话拜访来完成大部分营收。这是一门有效的技艺，但天哪，你得非常擅长才行。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Yeah, this line somewhere that if you can close on a text message, AI can close it.
(中文): 确实有这样一种说法：如果你能通过短信完成交易，那么人工智能也能做到。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Yes. It is. I'm being facetious in the sense that people say that I think have weaker relationships with customers. This is why people have weaker relationships with their customers than they think. Yeah. And if it's so easy to close the deal on a text message, and we've done hundreds of thousands of these and folks don't mind if it's an AI, if it's a good AI, why won't it close it on the text message? AI can be people too. It really can't. If you don't believe me, folks, go to Lennybot. Is that the old lennybot.com?
(中文): 是的，确实如此。我这么说带有讽刺意味，因为人们总认为他们与客户的关系其实没那么牢固。这就是为什么人们与客户的关系比他们想象的要薄弱。没错。如果通过短信就能轻易敲定交易——我们已经处理了成千上万这样的案例，而且如果AI足够出色，人们并不介意对方是不是真人——那为什么不能在短信上完成交易呢？AI也能扮演人的角色。实际上它并不能。各位如果不信，不妨去试试Lennybot。是那个旧的lennybot.com吗？

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Lennybot.com.
(中文): Lennybot.com。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: If you don't think AI can be people, people spend hours on Lennybot, don't they?
(中文): 如果你不认为AI能成为人，那人们花数小时在Lennybot上，不是吗？

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Yeah. And the best part is you could talk to Lennybot with voice. There's a voice feature that sounds exactly like me. It's unbelievable.
(中文): 是的。最棒的部分是你可以用语音和Lennybot对话。有一个语音功能听起来完全像我。简直难以置信。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Yeah. And a meta reason to go use Lennybot, go in with a learn in mind, don't go and bias. You will find that AI can be people people. People spend hours. Who are our best therapists today as we record this? ChatGPT is our best therapist on planet Earth. It's a people person. I mean, it sounds silly, but if that is your best defense in sales that you're a people person, the sands are sinking beneath you right now. It's not enough of a skill. People person is great when people buy enterprise software that's going to take two years to roll out and they have no idea how it works and it's a hope and a prayer. When you expect the agent to work during the pilot before the big check comes, people person is insufficient. Terrific. Tell me the person that's going to launch my agent, train it and get into production for me before I even pay you. This is the dream. Maybe this is one of the biggest changes of all. When I talk with Marc Benioff, and Salesforce is the biggest, right? It's 44 billion. It's the biggest ship to turn. He's like, "The number one thing I envy in Palantir, one is their high deal sizes." He made that joke in all the media and all the press. But the other thing is, he said, "I wish I could. I can't today. I wish every Salesforce customer now could go live before they pay." That is so different from how we've been trained in many ways to almost rip off the customer, to get them to buy the product, first try to avoid a pilot, then have the smallest pilot we can, then roll it out over years to different people. AI has upped the bar in terms of what customers expect. And that's why the best ones are blowing up because the ROI is so high. And so you've got to deliver the ROI before the document is e-signed today. People that haven't fully embraced that are at public companies growing 8%. They're still trying to play games.
(中文): 是的。还有一个更深层次的理由去使用Lennybot，那就是带着学习的心态去接触，而不是带着偏见。你会发现人工智能可以成为人际交往的高手。人们花费数小时。在我们录制这段内容时，谁是我们最好的治疗师？ChatGPT是地球上最好的治疗师。它善于与人打交道。我的意思是，这听起来可能有点傻，但如果你在销售中最大的优势仅仅是善于与人打交道，那么你现在脚下的沙地正在下沉。这已经不够了。当人们购买需要两年时间才能部署、他们完全不知道如何运作、只能寄予希望和祈祷的企业软件时，善于与人打交道是很好的。但当你期望代理在收到大额支票前的试点阶段就能发挥作用时，仅仅善于与人打交道就不够了。太棒了。告诉我那个能在我付款之前就为我启动代理、培训它并投入生产的人。这就是梦想。也许这是所有变化中最大的一个。当我和马克·贝尼奥夫交谈时，Salesforce是最大的，对吧？它价值440亿美元，是最大的需要转向的船。他说：“我最羡慕Palantir的一点，一是他们的大额交易规模。”他在所有媒体和新闻中都开了这个玩笑。但另一件事是，他说：“我希望我能。但我现在还做不到。我希望现在每个Salesforce客户都能在付款之前就上线使用。”这与我们在很多方面被训练的方式截然不同，我们几乎是在欺骗客户，让他们购买产品，首先尽量避免试点，然后进行尽可能小的试点，再花数年时间向不同的人推广。人工智能提高了客户的期望值。这就是为什么最好的公司正在爆炸式增长，因为投资回报率非常高。所以现在你必须在电子文件签署之前就交付投资回报率。那些没有完全接受这一点的上市公司，增长率只有8%。他们还在试图玩把戏。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: What are some other things that you think are going to change that people may not be thinking about that's going to change the way we do sales in the next couple years?
(中文): 你认为还有哪些人们可能尚未考虑到、但将在未来几年改变我们销售方式的事情？

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Net net, we're going to need more sales and go-to-market professionals than ever because the winners are growing so quickly that even if they're more efficient, they will need more human beings than ever. We'd have to put together a spreadsheet to see the crossover point. Obviously, many folks are shrinking headcount. Microsoft's already said they're past peak employee. They're never going to be bigger. We're seeing this all across the companies we work with. They want to be as lean as they can, but AI is such a huge part of our economy already. And it's such a force of nature. And everyone eventually goes enterprise. Everyone eventually has a sales team. Everyone eventually does it. It's happening faster. ElevenLabs, 50% of their sales is through enterprise now. I mean, I don't know everybody. The fact that Vercel just added Janine means they're going more enterprise by definition. I think Replit just added a sales team a couple months ago for real, and now they've added another CRO. So they got to a hundred and something million with no traditional sales team, but at a billion, it's going to be flooded with salespeople. So if you get great at this stuff, if you go buy an agent today, when you listen to this and deploy it yourself and do the hard work and train it and ingest it and iterate it every day and get ahead of it and then get two agents and then three and then four, you may become more valuable, have a better experience in ETM. And I believe, I hope, actually be better paid. I've talked about that we should have $250,000 a year SDRs, but they'd be like at Vercel, they'd be managing 10 agents, not 10 people. Then they're worth 250 grand. For sell, they'd be managing 10 agents, not 10 people. Then they're worth 250 grand, instead of 80 grand or 90 grand. It's not that much, is it? So, there is a great world coming. These are the best of times, aren't they, Lenny, for product and business? It's not evenly distributed. So, if you have those skills, even though we're not going to need these SDRs and even though not going to be BDRs, even though we can get rid of half of AEs, the amount of revenue and growth in AI leaders is so phenomenal, right? And not just at the startups, at the Google Clouds, at everywhere. Azure, they're hiring so many humans that net-net, it's a positive for the profession, but not for the way we've done it in the past. You're at risk.
(中文): 归根结底，我们将比以往任何时候都需要更多的销售和市场推广专业人士，因为行业领先者的发展速度如此之快，即便他们效率更高，仍然需要比以往更多的人手。我们需要制作一份电子表格来分析盈亏平衡点。显然，许多公司正在缩减员工规模。微软已经表示其员工数量已过峰值，未来不会再扩大规模。我们在合作的企业中普遍观察到这一现象。它们希望尽可能精简，但人工智能早已成为经济的重要组成部分，并且是一股不可阻挡的自然力量。最终每家企业都会走向规模化经营，最终都会建立销售团队，最终都会走上这条路——而且这个过程正在加速。例如ElevenLabs，目前其50%的销售额来自企业客户。当然我无法了解所有公司的情况，但Vercel刚聘请Janine这一事实本身就意味着他们正加速向企业级市场迈进。Replit几个月前才真正组建销售团队，现在又新增了一位首席营收官。他们曾在不依赖传统销售团队的情况下实现约1亿美元营收，但当规模达到10亿美元时，销售团队必将大幅扩张。

因此，如果你能精通这些技能——比如现在就开始部署智能代理，坚持每天投入精力训练优化、迭代升级，从一个代理逐步扩展到四个——你将在企业技术营销领域变得更有价值，获得更佳体验。我相信（也期望）这最终会带来更丰厚的报酬。我曾提出销售开发代表的年薪应达到25万美元，就像Vercel那样：他们管理的将是10个智能代理而非10名员工，这样的价值完全配得上25万美元而非8-9万美元。这样的跨越并不算大，不是吗？

一个美好的新时代正在来临。莱尼，这对产品和商业领域来说难道不是最好的时代吗？虽然机遇分布并不均衡，但如果你掌握这些技能，即使未来不再需要传统销售开发代表和业务拓展代表，即使半数客户经理可能被替代，人工智能领军企业带来的营收增长依然惊人——不仅限于初创公司，谷歌云等所有平台都是如此。以Azure为例，他们正在大规模招募人才。因此从净效益来看，这对销售行业是积极的，但不同于过去的运作模式。如果你固守旧方式，就将面临风险。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: That is really interesting that we're still hiring. And this is what I've seen too, just like everyone's hiring salespeople, go-to-market people. Do you think there's going to be this peak in the next couple years of just, okay, now that AI is doing more and more of this, or is it just hard to predict because who knows how big AI gets, how big these companies get?
(中文): 我们仍在招聘，这确实很有趣。我也看到了同样的情况，就像每个人都在招聘销售人员、市场推广人员一样。你认为未来几年会不会出现一个高峰，比如现在AI正在越来越多地承担这些工作，或者只是因为难以预测，毕竟谁知道AI会发展到多大，这些公司会发展到多大呢？

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: I mean, IT's over a trillion dollars, and it's accelerating. AI is increasing the amount. Gartner says next year will be the fastest acceleration of money deployed into IT and software in a decade. It's reaccelerated. Can that last forever? No. Eventually we consume 100% of the global GDP. There's no money left to buy. There are some limits. But I don't think you and I and anyone, any of the millions of people that follow you, I don't think we got to think too much more than three to 40 years out here. It's too much. There's too much change. If you become a master of the universe in AI, you will be hyper employable the next two to three years. And if you stay with a learner's mind, that will just compound. And so, you will have a job that I think is far more interesting, even if more tiring than we used to have. But the days of working 20 hours a week and phoning it in and getting a few deals, I think that was a great time. Even you had a little bit of that. I think you're working harder than you used to, aren't you?
(中文): 我是说，IT领域投入已超万亿美元，而且还在加速。人工智能正在推动资金规模增长。高德纳咨询公司预测，明年将是十年来IT和软件领域资金部署增速最快的一年。这种加速态势正在重启。这种趋势能永远持续吗？不能。最终我们会耗尽全球GDP的100%。届时将无钱可投。确实存在某些限制。但我认为，包括你我在内，以及关注你的数百万观众，我们都不需要看得太远，最多考虑未来三到四十年就够了。变数太多，变化太剧烈。如果你能成为人工智能领域的顶尖专家，未来两到三年你将极具就业竞争力。而若始终保持学习者的心态，这种优势还会不断累积。因此，你将拥有一份我认为远比过去更有趣的工作——即便可能更耗费心力。但那种每周工作20小时、敷衍应付就能完成几笔交易的日子，我认为确实是段美好时光。就连你也曾经历过那样的阶段。你现在工作比以前更拼了，不是吗？

[Lenny Rachitsky]: I am, I am.
(中文): 我是，我是。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: I mean, the classic Lenny vibe at 100,000 subscribers was, leave me alone. I take a lot of vacations. I do some good work. I mean, it's still part of your vibe, but I think you're working harder.
(中文): 我是说，Lenny在拥有10万订阅者时的经典风格是：别来烦我。我经常休假，但也做些不错的工作。我的意思是，这仍然是你的风格的一部分，但我觉得你现在工作更努力了。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: I'm working incredibly hard. I am. The original idea was create this chill newsletter life. I'm just going to write a newsletter once a week. Life's going to be good. And it's just hard to pass up on really cool opportunities and do more, help it grow bigger. I couldn't resist. So, yeah, I'm working and that should be hard.
(中文): 我正拼尽全力地工作。真的。最初的设想是打造这种轻松惬意的电子报生活——每周只写一期，日子本该悠闲自在。但面对那些绝佳的机会，实在难以拒绝，总想做得更多，让它发展得更壮大。我终究没能抵挡住这种诱惑。所以，是的，我在努力奋斗，而这过程本就该充满艰辛。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: And that should be all of us though. If you're not feeling what you said or even a version of what I said, then you're not living the AI dream today. It is more work. It should be tiring. Even if it's better in some ways, it is just more work. But this is the most exciting time of our lifetimes to be in software. I mean, good God. I can't even code Lenny, and I've built 12 apps on Replit in the last 150 days used by a million times. I've been waiting 10 years for some of these folks to build some of these apps. I just did it myself, right? I literally, just when I was in London, I built a whole app where you can practice selling Harvey, Cursor, Replit, and ChatGPT Enterprise, and it works. This wasn't even possible at the start of the year, was it? So, these are magical times. And the fact that we can run an eight figure business with three people and 20 agents, it's like, get excited or go join one of these really slow growing... My advice is pick one of two paths today. Either be working harder like even you and I are. We don't have to. Or honestly, I will say the truth is there are a thousand unicorns born in 2021. 800 of them are growing pretty slowly. We'll never IPO, may not have an exit, but they're okay with 8% or 15% growth. If you don't want to be on the journey we talked about, I'm not judging. I get it. We're humans, right? We have families. Not all of us are obsessed. I think I'm obsessed. I think you've become more obsessed. If that's not you, join something more slow growing. They still need people. Not as many, they still need people. But I would pick a lane for next year. Don't pretend that there's this middle path going to start because it don't exist in GTM. And I don't think it exists in product or engineering either.
(中文): 然而，这应当是我们所有人的状态。如果你没有感受到自己所说的，甚至是我所描述的某种版本，那么你今天就没有活在人工智能的梦想中。这需要付出更多努力，理应让人感到疲惫。即便在某些方面有所改善，它终究意味着更多的工作量。但此时此刻，正是我们职业生涯中投身软件领域最激动人心的时代。我的天啊，我甚至不会编写Lenny的代码，却在过去150天里在Replit上构建了12个应用程序，被使用了上百万次。我等了十年，期待某些人开发出这类应用，最终却亲手实现了，不是吗？就在伦敦期间，我构建了一个完整的应用程序，让你可以练习销售Harvey、Cursor、Replit和ChatGPT企业版，而且它真的运行起来了。这在年初时甚至是不可能的，对吧？所以，这是一个充满魔力的时代。我们能用三个人和二十个智能体运营一家八位数规模的企业，这简直令人振奋——要么为此兴奋，要么去加入那些增长极其缓慢的……我的建议是，今天就从两条道路中选择其一。要么像你我一样更加努力地工作——我们本不必如此，但事实如此。或者坦率地说，真相是：2021年诞生了上千家独角兽企业，其中八百家增长相当缓慢。它们可能永远无法上市，或许没有退出机会，但对8%或15%的增长速度已感到满足。如果你不想踏上我们讨论的这段旅程，我并无评判之意。我理解。我们是人类，对吧？我们有家庭。并非所有人都如此痴迷。我认为我痴迷于此，我觉得你也变得更加投入。如果这不是你的追求，那就加入增长更缓慢的领域。它们仍然需要人才——虽然需求不如前者旺盛，但依然需要人手。不过，我会为明年选定一条道路。不要幻想存在一条即将开启的中间路径，因为在市场进入策略中它并不存在。我认为在产品或工程领域也同样如此。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: I love just how excited you are about this. Just like you could tell on Twitter just how fun this is for you, just learning and sharing. And I love that you're sharing it, but I think it's just a symptom of you're just so excited about what's happening and what you're learning and it's just like you can't help but share it. I'm in the same way. I'm just like, "Oh shit, I go to this really cool thing. I got to tweet about it."
(中文): 我真的很喜欢你对此如此兴奋的样子。就像在推特上能看出这对你来说多么有趣，仅仅是学习和分享的过程。我特别欣赏你愿意分享，但我觉得这恰恰反映出你对正在发生的事情和所学到的东西有多么激动，以至于你情不自禁地想要分享。我也完全一样。我常常会想，“天啊，我参加了这么酷的活动，必须发条推文分享一下。”

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: It is just magical that our ability to build things that we couldn't build before or build in ways and paces, and it's accelerating. I mean, we could talk about it forever, but even for me, I picked Replit because Twitter told me to, I could have picked another tool. I'm not an investor and I'm not even biased, but I'm in the top 1%.
(中文): 我们能够以前所未有的方式和速度建造事物，并且这一进程正在加速，这简直太神奇了。我的意思是，我们可以永远谈论这个话题，但即便是我，选择Replit也是因为Twitter的推荐，我本可以选择其他工具。我并非投资者，甚至没有任何偏见，但我确实处于顶尖的1%之中。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Just to double down what you said, you're top 1% user of Replit?
(中文): 只是想再次确认你刚才说的，你是Replit平台上前1%的用户吗？

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Yeah.
(中文): 是的。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Wow.
(中文): 哇。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Yeah.
(中文): 是的。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: I love that.
(中文): 我喜欢这个。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: So, it really didn't work well when I started about 170 days ago. Then a V2 came out and it got better. The hallucinations went away. And then this is just like you got to get excited about. Folks may not know this and other tools. When V3 came out, I don't know, 45 days ago, now it has agents talking to agents. So, what happens is, and again, I can't really code. So, when I have an issue and I'm trying to figure out how to do something, the agent calls in an architect or another agent and they debate and argue with it and they come up with the right answer. The first time this happened, I just fell out of my chair. Not only is it magical, I mean, great, you can do a prompt and build a crappy app that doesn't work. Now, 150 days later, you have agents debating how to build better code with each other and you don't even need to know how to code. The only greater time is going to be next year, right? I've been waiting. I've been waiting, right? And just the things that you can build today. And I mean, you know this, but other folks, I mean, that's me building without being able to code. The other captain obvious thing, why are folks so productive on all these tools? I mean, every bit of open source software in the world is in these tools. If you want to build something that's been built before, it's so easy. The novel stuff's really hard, right? It's not any easier, but man, it's just these are great. And so, for GTM, for sales, it's a couple beats behind. And there's probably a bunch of reasons for it. Some of it is, I think ironically is just where founders are interested. So, marketing is behind sales for AI. AI, SGR has exploded. I don't really know why. I invested in a couple of pre-AI tools. I invested in Salesloft, which was sold for two and a half billion. It was like the last deal of the 2020 ones, like the seed investment. No one wanted to be in that category. Now everyone in the world wants to build an AI, SDR, AIR, CRM. But marketing is slower just because people don't really want to build the cursor for marketing. People say they do, but it will get there. But the innovation will just accelerate. It's just going to accelerate. So, don't be a skeptic on this stuff. If you're not as excited as me, then here's my last bit of advice on this for folks. If you don't feel what I feel, here's my advice over the holidays. When you have a quiet moment when you're having your mold wine or your hot chocolate or whatever, fire up your browser, do it incognito, go to your app and do everything with a fresh Gmail address. Try support. See how your support is. Try to contact sales. Sign up for the newsletter. Do everything. Try your product. If you do this quietly, your heart, you're going to cry about some of the things you've seen. You're going to cry how bad your support is. You're going to cry how long it takes sales to get back to you. You're going to cry about a couple things. Pick the thing that makes you cry the most over your mold wine and go buy that agent and fix it. And then you will have the passion that we have. I always counsel people to do this. It just wasn't as actionable before AI. You just get lost. You forget about the onboarding workflow and you forget about support and you forget how bad contact me and you're so lost in the strategic. So, you got it once a year, ideally once a quarter, just do this Incognito mode test. And even for Lenny's newsletter, I bet we can find some part you forgot to touch.
(中文): 所以，大约170天前我开始使用时，效果确实不太好。后来V2版本推出，情况有所改善。幻觉问题消失了。这确实令人兴奋。可能有些人还不了解这个工具以及其他类似工具。大约45天前V3版本发布，现在它已经能让智能体之间进行对话了。具体来说——重申一下我其实不太会编程——当我遇到问题想弄清楚怎么做时，智能体会召集架构师或其他智能体，它们会展开辩论和讨论，最终得出正确答案。第一次看到这个场景时，我简直震惊得从椅子上跳起来。这不仅是魔法般的体验，更重要的是：以前你只能通过提示词生成一个粗糙且运行不畅的应用程序，但150天后的现在，智能体们已经开始互相辩论如何编写更好的代码，而你甚至不需要懂编程。明年肯定会迎来更伟大的时刻，对吧？我一直在期待，一直在等待。想想现在就能构建的东西——虽然你了解这些，但其他人可能不知道——这就是我这种不懂编程的人也能创造的成果。另一个显而易见的事实是：为什么人们使用这些工具时效率如此之高？因为世界上所有的开源软件都融入了这些工具。如果你想构建已有的东西，简直易如反掌。当然，创新性内容仍然非常困难，但这并不影响这些工具的卓越性。

至于市场推广和销售领域，目前还落后几个节拍。这可能有多方面原因，有趣的是部分原因在于创始人们的兴趣点——在AI领域，营销的发展落后于销售。AI销售开发领域已经爆发式增长，虽然我不完全清楚原因。我曾投资过几个前AI时代的工具，比如以25亿美元被收购的Salesloft，那是2020年最后一轮种子投资，当时没人看好这个类别。而现在全世界都想开发AI销售开发工具或AI客户关系管理系统。营销领域发展较慢，主要是因为人们尚未真正想为营销领域打造"光标级"工具。虽然有人声称在做，但迟早会实现。创新只会加速，必将加速。

所以不要对此持怀疑态度。如果你没有我这样的热情，我最后给各位的建议是：如果你无法感同身受，请在假期找个安静时刻——无论是品着陈年葡萄酒还是热巧克力——打开浏览器无痕模式，用全新的Gmail账户体验所有流程：测试客服系统、联系销售、订阅新闻邮件、全面试用产品。当你平静地完成这些，你会为自己看到的一些情况感到痛心：客服质量之差、销售回复之慢……选择最让你痛心的环节，购入相应的智能体工具来解决它。这样你就能拥有和我们一样的热情。我一直建议人们这样做，只是在AI时代之前这个建议难以落实——人们容易迷失方向，忽略用户引导流程、忽视客服体验、忘记"联系我"功能的糟糕程度，过于沉迷战略规划。理想情况下，每年甚至每季度都应该进行一次无痕模式测试。就连Lenny的新闻邮件，我敢打赌也能发现被忽略的细节。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Nope.
(中文): 不。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: No, you disagree?
(中文): 不，你不同意吗？

[Lenny Rachitsky]: It's not going to happen. I'm just joking.
(中文): 这不会发生的。我只是在开玩笑。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: You'd be like, "Oh my God, I can't believe I didn't touch that since I launched the Substack. It doesn't even go to the right. That place gets a 404."
(中文): 你可能会说："天啊，真不敢相信自从我推出Substack以来就没碰过那个。它甚至无法正确跳转。那个地方显示404错误。"

[Lenny Rachitsky]: I'm going to do this over the holiday. Usually, the advice would've been, "Okay, email your product manager and tell them you found all these bugs." What you're saying here is no, find an agent to take care of this in the future, make this a much better experience for everyone always.
(中文): 我打算在假期期间处理这件事。通常的建议会是："好的，给你的产品经理发邮件，告诉他们你发现了所有这些漏洞。"而你在这里说的是不，要找一个代理来负责处理这类问题，让每个人始终都能有更好的体验。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Yeah. Yeah. And if it's the one that makes you cry, it may motivate you to do it.
(中文): 是的。是的。如果那件事让你想哭，它或许能激励你去做。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Yeah. And it's not like you have to publish it to production. It's not like you have to have your CEO approve this thing. It's just like, show them what you might be able to do. Here's what I did over the weekend. Maybe we should explore doing this thing with our site.
(中文): 是的。而且这并不意味着你必须将其发布到生产环境。也不是说必须得到CEO的批准。这更像是，向他们展示你可能做到的事情。这是我周末做的一些尝试。也许我们应该考虑在我们的网站上探索实施这个想法。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Yeah, the jaw is just my job.
(中文): 是的，下巴只是我的工作。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Yeah.
(中文): 是的。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Yeah.
(中文): 是的。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Oh, man. Jason, I feel like I could chat with you for hours, but I think this is a good point to wrap things up. Is there anything that you wanted to share or is there anything you want to leave listeners with?
(中文): 哎呀，老兄。杰森，我觉得我能跟你聊上好几个小时，不过现在确实是个不错的收尾时机。你还有什么想分享的吗？或者有什么话想留给听众的？

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: One last thing maybe that comes up that I've learned that are on people's minds and we can't break is a lot of folks are concerned, "Hey, this will unpack people's jobs. What do I do? Okay, I did what you said. I did the incognito mode. I'm going to bring in this agent, this sales agent or this support agent. I've tried, I've even did it, but I'm worried I'm going to get pushback and people are going to lose their jobs." I don't have the perfect answer to this one, but I think be honest about it, be honest that for the best people, it will make them more productive. For the best people, it will be even fun. For the best people, they will be better at their job. And if it is a threat to some of the folks on the team, the future is coming anyway. We might as well embrace it. So, it's just when I hear, I would be positive about it. I would explain it helps the best people, but I don't think dancing around it is the right answer in your organization. It will result in change. And if some jobs change from one role to the other, that's life in the age of AI. Don't hide it. I don't think it helps.
(中文): 最后一点，或许也是大家关心且难以回避的问题，我了解到许多人都在担忧："嘿，这会不会抢走人们的工作？我该怎么办？好吧，我按你说的做了。我用了隐身模式，引入了这个代理，无论是销售代理还是客服代理。我试过了，甚至已经实施了，但我担心会遭到抵制，担心有人会因此失业。" 对此我没有完美的答案，但我认为应该坦诚面对，诚实地告诉人们：对于最优秀的人才，这将提升他们的工作效率；对于最优秀的人才，这甚至会带来乐趣；对于最优秀的人才，这将使他们工作得更好。如果这对团队中的某些人构成威胁，那么未来终将到来，我们不妨拥抱它。所以，每当我听到这样的担忧，我都会持积极态度。我会解释说，这有助于最优秀的人才，但我认为在组织里回避这个问题并非良策。变革终将发生。如果一些工作岗位从一种角色转变为另一种，这就是人工智能时代的生活现实。不要隐瞒，我认为这并无益处。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: I love that in your case and in Jean's case at Vercel, it's not like you let anyone go. In your case, the SDRs quit. And in her case, she moved them from, I believe, from inbound to outbound or outbound to inbound. She just reshuffled them to do to have higher impact somewhere else.
(中文): 我很欣赏你和Vercel的Jean的做法，你们都没有解雇任何人。在你这里，是销售开发代表们自己选择了离职。而在她那里，据我所知，她只是将团队从入站销售调整到出站销售，或是反过来。她所做的不过是重新调配人员，让他们在别处发挥更大的影响力。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: I think that's a really important point. This is another thing that I think the media creates too much drama on. I mean, AI has led to some layoffs, but even though most of the ones we read, it's just a justification to do layoffs. It's just a reason to blame it on it. What's a much bigger issue is that people just won't be backfilled with humans. We will use AI to backfill. That's what we did. We didn't fire. I've never fired anyone my whole career other than for inappropriate conduct a few times that you fired today for that stuff. But pretty much I've never fired anyone that didn't do something inappropriate. When they go, this time we just said, now it's the agents, right? And so, that's a much bigger force of nature than some random layoffs, which probably aren't really new to AI, right? It's probably not because you brought in 20 agents in 2025. It's probably because you just want to downsize anyway, and this is the excuse. So, it's probably less of a threat to you than you think AI. But what it does mean is if you don't want to embrace it, Lenny, maybe don't leave your current job. Yeah.
(中文): 我认为这一点非常重要。这也是我觉得媒体过度渲染的另一个方面。我的意思是，人工智能确实导致了一些裁员，但我们看到的大多数报道，其实只是企业为裁员找的借口。他们只是把责任推到人工智能身上。一个更严重的问题是，许多岗位空缺将不再由人类填补，而是用人工智能来替代。我们就是这么做的——我们并没有解雇员工。在我的整个职业生涯中，除了少数因不当行为而解雇的情况（就像今天处理这类问题一样），我几乎没有解雇过任何人。基本上，我从未解雇过没有不当行为的员工。当岗位出现空缺时，我们这次决定用智能代理来填补，对吧？所以，这比那些可能并非真正由人工智能引起的随意裁员，影响要深远得多。那些裁员很可能并不是因为你引入了2025年的20个智能代理，而只是企业本就想要缩减规模，人工智能成了借口。因此，人工智能对你构成的威胁可能比你想象的要小。但这确实意味着，如果你不想拥抱人工智能，莱尼，也许最好不要离开你现在的工作。是的。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: I was just going to say...
(中文): 我正想说...

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Maybe don't leave your current job.
(中文): 或许不要辞掉你现在的工作。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Because the new place might not be hiring for this role.
(中文): 因为新地方可能不招聘这个职位。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Yeah. God, I have a sales exec who I love. I've known for many years and he went from a 100K job, then almost an 800K job, then down to a 200K job, then left that one because he didn't like it and now he can't get a job at all. He's back in school. So, maybe stay.
(中文): 是的。天哪，我手下有个销售主管，我特别欣赏他。认识他很多年了，他先是辞掉了一份10万美元的工作，接着差点拿到80万美元的职位，后来降到20万美元，又因为不喜欢那份工作而离职，现在却完全找不到工作了。他目前重返校园了。所以，或许还是留下来比较好。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: There we go.
(中文): 好了。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: We all maybe stay. No shame in staying, is there?
(中文): 我们或许都会留下。留下来并不可耻，不是吗？

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Yeah. I like that. Well, with that, Jason, we have reached our very exciting lighting round. This is your second time going through a lightning round, so I'll make it quick. First question, what are a couple books you often find yourself recommending to other people?
(中文): 是的，我喜欢这样。那么，杰森，我们即将进入非常激动人心的快速问答环节。这是你第二次经历快速问答，所以我会加快速度。第一个问题，你经常向别人推荐哪几本书？

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: I was recently asked to write a forward for a book from one of the revenue leaders I have the most respect for in the world. I read a little bit of it. I couldn't do it because as good as it was, it was dated. It wasn't current enough in AI. I don't know what we said at this... It might've been before we started the pod. The plays all work, but the playbooks don't really work as well. So, many of these GTM books are playbooks, especially folks selling courses and stuff, but they're playbooks. Run from the playbooks, embrace the plays. And so, read all these go to-market and sales books and take great items from them, which was always the goal from a book. Pick two or three things out of it. But I think I'm waiting for the next level of books and GTM and 2026 because everything I've read, it's just too backwards looking. So, just be a skeptic. Grab the plays, but don't adopt the playbook. I just
(中文): 最近，一位我极为敬重的全球营收领域领军人物邀请我为他的书作序。我翻阅了部分内容，但最终无法应允——尽管书稿质量上乘，却已与时代脱节。尤其在人工智能方面，其内容未能跟上最新发展。我不确定我们当时是如何讨论的……或许那是在我们开启播客节目之前。书中的战略思路本身依然有效，但具体执行手册的实用性已大打折扣。事实上，许多这类市场开拓类书籍都偏向于提供固定模板，尤其是那些推销课程之类的作品，它们本质上都是标准化手册。我的建议是：摆脱手册的束缚，拥抱灵活的战略思维。因此，在阅读所有市场开拓与销售类书籍时，请保持批判态度，从中汲取精华——这原本就是阅读此类书籍的核心目的。每本书选取两三个有价值的概念即可。但我认为，我正在期待2026年能出现新一代更前瞻的市场开拓著作，因为目前我所读到的内容都过于沉湎于过往经验。总之，请保持怀疑精神。汲取战略智慧，但切勿全盘照搬执行手册。这就是我的观点。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Had the head of growth from Lovable, Elena Vernon on the podcast. She had the same advice. Then all these playbooks that she's used over the last 20 years in growth just don't work anymore at AI companies. Next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you have really enjoyed?
(中文): 在播客中邀请了Lovable的增长主管埃琳娜·弗农。她给出了相同的建议。她过去20年在增长领域使用的所有策略手册，在AI公司中都不再适用了。下一个问题。你最近有没有特别喜欢的电影或电视剧？

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: What's this one called? What's it called? Pluribus? Is that what it's called?
(中文): 这个叫什么？它叫什么？普利布勒斯吗？是这么叫的吗？

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Pluribus, yeah.
(中文): 普路里巴斯，是的。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Okay.
(中文): 好的。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: I've been watching that.
(中文): 我一直在关注那个。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: So, it's a good show. This is what I realized is why you should be excited about AI and GTM is Pluribus because in Pluribus, there's like a hive mind, right? All the people accept 11 people or 13 people. They're all connected. People don't get this. This is why right now, the whole point when we're doing this, maybe we'll do a third one if I'm lucky. The whole point is just get your AI agents to be almost as good as humans, but working 24/7 and at scale, that's pretty good. If it can do 10 or 100 times more work, 24/7, as pretty good as your human, that's a resource you don't even have today. It's not that complicated. When AI really is the hive mind, when it can share all of the data across all of your agents and knows everything that happens, then humans are at risk in GTM. They're going to be so much better when they're the hive mind. Right now, our hive, and there's a bit of a Renaissance for Salesforce as a CRM. There's a bunch of reasons, even though it's old, it's founded in the '90s, it has become the hub for these AI GTM agents. They all plug in. So, Salesforce has become the database for all these. So, that's a little hint of the Pluribus hive mind. But when all these agents can talk with each other for real and share all their GTM data and all the customer data and everything on the next time we do it, the 3.8 million people that read Lenny's and all the agents can share data together, I don't mean to turn Pluribus into an AI GTM show, but there's my connection, but it's pretty good, right?
(中文): 所以，这确实是个不错的节目。我意识到这正是为什么你应该对人工智能和GTM感到兴奋——Pluribus就是这样一个例子。因为在Pluribus里，存在一种类似蜂群思维的模式，对吧？所有人都接受11人或13人的设定，他们彼此相连。很多人还没理解这一点。这就是为什么我们现在做这件事的核心意义，如果运气好的话，或许我们还会推出第三期。关键在于，让人工智能代理达到几乎与人类相当的水平，却能24/7全天候大规模工作，这已经很了不起了。如果它能以接近人类的水准，24/7完成十倍甚至百倍的工作量，那将是当今尚未拥有的强大资源。其实并不复杂。当人工智能真正形成蜂群思维，当它能在所有代理间共享数据、通晓一切动态时，人类在GTM领域就将面临挑战。一旦形成蜂群思维，它们的效率将大幅提升。目前，我们的"蜂群"正在经历一场复兴——Salesforce作为CRM系统正重焕生机。尽管它诞生于90年代，历史悠久，但如今已成为这些人工智能GTM代理的核心枢纽，所有代理都能接入其中。因此，Salesforce已演变为所有这些数据的存储库。这算是Pluribus蜂群思维的一个缩影。但当所有代理真正实现互联互通，共享全部GTM数据、客户数据以及未来我们再次行动时的一切信息——比如Lenny's的380万读者与所有代理的数据协同——我并非想把Pluribus变成人工智能GTM专题节目，但这其中的关联确实很有价值，对吧？

[Lenny Rachitsky]: I get it. I get it. Oh man, that show's so good. I feel like every episode, I get these pushes from Apple TV of like, there's a new episode of Pluribus. I'm like, "I can't wait to go watch that." Each episode ends in like, oh, I can't wait to see what happens next. Okay. Is there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love, like an app or a gadget or clothing?
(中文): 我明白了。我明白了。天啊，那部剧真是太棒了。感觉每一集，苹果TV都会推送提醒，比如《普利比乌斯》有新剧集了。我就想，“我等不及要去看了。”每一集结束时都让人意犹未尽，迫不及待想知道接下来会发生什么。好的。最近有没有发现你特别喜欢的某个产品，比如应用、小工具或者服装？

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Maybe not in the last two weeks. I'll just give a small one just for GTM one.
(中文): 可能过去两周没有。我就给一个针对GTM的小例子。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Yeah, that's okay.
(中文): 是的，没问题。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Because everyone's about Sora this and all of this and video and I love it. I get it. But there is an app called Reve. It used to be Revar. It's for imaging. And the folks that build it built their own image LLMs on their own. And the reason I bring this up, I use it every single day is because it can do a lot of cool things with a prompt, right? But if you want to do cool stuff for marketing, if you want to create a great image, I have a CMMO buying my product doing this. I don't know a tool that is better for that kind of stuff. That stuff that we used to torture, we used to fire up Canva and try to create things or even worse, wait four days for someone to do it for you. This is one of my cheat sheets. I have a couple tools that I use that people don't get, but now it's app.reveai. It changed its name. But it's just a simple prompt to go to it, type in whatever image you want to make. And for a lot of the boring B2B stuff we like to do, I find it's the best.
(中文): 大家都在谈论Sora，还有视频相关的一切，我对此非常喜欢，也完全理解。但有一款应用叫Reve，它以前叫Revar，是用于图像生成的。开发这款应用的人完全自主构建了他们自己的图像大语言模型。我之所以提起这个，是因为我每天都在使用它，它能通过简单的提示实现许多酷炫的效果，对吧？如果你想为营销制作吸引人的内容，或者想创作出色的图像，我的首席营销官就在用这个工具来购买我的产品。我不知道还有比这更适合这类工作的工具了。过去我们常常为此烦恼，要么打开Canva费力尝试创作，甚至更糟的是，要等上四天让别人来完成。这是我的一些小窍门之一。我有几款常用工具，别人可能不太了解，但现在它叫app.reveai，改名了。使用起来很简单，只需输入提示，描述你想生成的任何图像。对于我们常做的那些枯燥的B2B内容，我发现它是最佳选择。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: And it's Reve.com?
(中文): 是Reve.com吗？

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Yeah. Reve.com.
(中文): 是的。Reve.com。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: I'm looking at it right now. Capybara delivering matcha through a quite must garden.
(中文): 我正看着它。一只水豚正穿过一片相当茂盛的花园递送抹茶。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: App.reve.com.
(中文): App.reve.com。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Yeah, sweet.
(中文): 好的，没问题。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Oh, you're making the image, you said?
(中文): 哦，你说你在制作图片吗？

[Lenny Rachitsky]: I'm just like, they're giving me examples here while I'm on the website here. Yeah, this is great. And you're saying this is better than Nano Banana and all these other...
(中文): 我就像，他们在我浏览网站时给我举例子。是的，这太棒了。而且你说这比纳米香蕉和其他那些都要好……

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: For this use case. You and I, we just want to do...
(中文): 对于这个使用场景，你和我，我们只想做...

[Lenny Rachitsky]: For marketing images?
(中文): 用于营销图片吗？

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: I want to do a thumb. I want an image for my article. My niche thing, content I just want to do. I've got to do it. I just don't think there's anything better for this use case. Sweet. I use it two or three times a day and I use all this stuff.
(中文): 我想做个缩略图。我需要为我的文章配张图。这是我的小众领域，是我想要创作的内容。我必须得做。我觉得没有比这更适合这个用途的了。太棒了。我每天用两三次，所有这些功能都用上了。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Okay. The alpha, more alpha to share with the audience. Okay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often find yourself coming back to in work or in life that you often maybe even share with other people?
(中文): 好的，再给观众分享一些更核心的观点。好的，还有两个问题。你是否有特别喜爱的人生格言，无论是在工作还是生活中都常常会想起，甚至可能经常与他人分享？

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: I'll just tell you one in the weird time we're at. This is probably your best startup. Just talking yesterday with a friend of mine, startup just raised 20 million from a top two or three VC. Founder just quit the next day. Just on the call the other day, yesterday, CEO of a company at 250 million, just quit. No success or no anyone to join a hot AI startup. Maybe, maybe, maybe. Most of the time, there are times and places to just quit when you have customers, when you have a million or two million or five or 10 million in revenue. But we often think it's easier to get back, to get back to that 10 million of revenue, to get back to 100 happy customers or 200 pap. It might seem easier to quit in the age of AI, but I'd rather take those 500 happy customers, build that badass AI product and sell it to 500 happy customers and go off to find them from scratch. Go off to find that 10 or 20 million. I literally had a third conversation with the founder just crossing a hundred million that wanted to leave and do a robotic startup after 10 years. I'm like, "I get it, man, but you have nine figures of equity in this company. Maybe go to the next level." So, there's so much going on. They're decelerating, accelerating. I just usually think the best startup for founders, not necessarily for everybody else, is the one you're already working at. And if you're not happy, turn that into your hot AI startup. Here's the thing. It's not too late, Lenny. Sometimes it feels like it's too late on social media. Maybe it's too late to build the next ChatGPT on the cheap. Okay. But for most stuff, it's not too late. It's still so early. We don't even have great AI marketing tools. We're really early on these AI SDRs. The markets have not hardened. The LLMs are getting so much better. Dude, if you want it's not too late. So, the best startup you're ever going to have probably is the one you're working at today. Don't quit. Don't quit if you have happy customers. Maybe that's how it is. Don't quit if you have happy customers. They'll buy more from you.
(中文): 我就说一个当下这个奇怪时期的现象。这很可能是你最好的创业机会。昨天刚和我一个朋友聊到，有家初创公司刚从顶级风投那里融了2000万美元，结果创始人第二天就辞职了。就在前几天，昨天还有个电话里提到，一家估值2.5亿美元公司的CEO，突然就离职了。现在甚至没人愿意加入热门的人工智能初创公司。也许吧，也许吧，也许吧。很多时候，当你拥有客户，当你有100万、200万、500万甚至1000万美元营收时，确实存在合适的时机和场合可以考虑退出。但我们常常以为重新回到那个千万营收水平、重新赢得100或200个满意客户会更容易。在人工智能时代，放弃看似更容易，但我宁愿选择那500个满意客户，打造出卓越的人工智能产品，先服务好这500个客户，再从头开始寻找新客户。重新去争取那1000万或2000万营收。我最近刚第三次和一位创始人交谈，他的公司刚突破一亿美元估值，做了十年后却想离开去做机器人创业。我说："我理解，兄弟，但你现在公司里的股权价值已经九位数了。或许应该考虑更上一层楼。"所以现在情况很复杂。有人在减速，有人在加速。我通常认为，对创始人而言（不一定对其他人），最好的创业项目就是你已经在做的这个。如果你不满意，那就把它转型成你的人工智能热门项目。关键是，莱尼，现在还不算晚。虽然在社交媒体上有时感觉已经太迟了。也许现在想低成本打造下一个ChatGPT确实晚了。但对于大多数领域来说，一切才刚刚开始。我们甚至还没有成熟的人工智能营销工具。人工智能销售开发代表领域才刚起步。市场格局尚未定型。大型语言模型正在飞速进步。兄弟，只要你愿意，现在绝对不晚。所以，你可能拥有的最好创业项目，很可能就是你今天正在做的这个。不要放弃。如果你有满意的客户，千万别放弃。也许这就是现实——只要有满意的客户就别放弃。他们会继续购买你的产品。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: I love advice like that that's empowering and optimistic and destresses people, I think, in a lot of ways. So, that is great. Final question. So, how many SaaStr have you done at this point? How many years have SaaStr have there been?
(中文): 我喜欢那种充满力量、积极向上、并且在很多方面能帮助人们减压的建议，这真的很棒。最后一个问题，到目前为止你参加过多少次SaaStr活动了？SaaStr已经举办了多少年了？

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Good God. We did some meetups. You know that, right? And then we did the first bigger one in 2015. So, 2016, we did take a break in 2020, but we did in 2021. We're the only event in the Bay Area in 2021. So, is that 12 of them? 12 years? It's a long time, man.
(中文): 天哪。我们办过几次聚会。这你是知道的，对吧？然后在2015年我们办了第一次规模较大的聚会。所以，2016年，2020年我们确实停办了一次，但2021年我们又恢复了。我们是2021年湾区唯一举办的活动。那么，这是第12次了吗？12年了？时间真长啊，伙计。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: And then how many talks have there been across those would you say total?
(中文): 那么你认为这些会谈总共进行了多少次？

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: I know we've done seven in Europe. So, 12 in the US and seven in Europe.
(中文): 我知道我们在欧洲已经完成了七场。所以，美国十二场，欧洲七场。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: So, about 20. Okay, 20 events.
(中文): 那么，大约20个。好吧，20个事件。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: Twenty bigger events. Yeah. I don't know. The annual one, probably if you count the smaller ones, 300. So, 3,000, 4,000 over the years.
(中文): 二十场大型活动。是的。我不太确定。年度活动的话，如果算上规模较小的那些，大概有300场。所以，这些年加起来大概有3,000到4,000场。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: So, then here's the question. What's your favorite talk across all those events? Is the one you're like, "Oh, this one really stood out. This is one I always share with people"? One that you think you'd want people to check out if they were to check out one talk across all SaaStr.
(中文): 那么，问题来了。在所有那些活动中，你最喜欢的演讲是哪一场？有没有哪一场让你觉得“哇，这场真的特别出彩，我总是会推荐给别人看”？如果人们要在SaaStr的所有演讲中选一场来看，你觉得哪一场是你最想推荐他们去了解的？

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: It's interesting. It's like a lot of things in B2B. Everything was pretty much the same for 10 years, and then all of a sudden everything's out of date, right? If you wanted to watch an older one, not that old, but old in internet AI time that I think will change the way you think. Watch the one I did with Ben Chestnut right after they got acquired. Because that's a magical time. It's called Everything That Breaks On The Way to One Billion. It's only got 23,000 views. That's nothing for Lenny, but for me, that's pretty good. Okay. And it's a moment in time right after he sold a billion-dollar company where he talks about how the deal almost fell apart, where he challenges almost every B2B metric we know. Running a profitable business at that scale, not really caring about CLTV and CAC or any of these things, what really matters for customers. Is MailChimp as cutting edge as it was today? Maybe not. But that's one when I look at it because everything's the same. We don't really get challenged in the way we think everyone's talking their book. You're so good at getting people to not talk their book, but that one I think is a great one. And then if people wanted to watch a GTM one, just some favorite ones, we do this one. It's a recent one. Because these guys were on my team, Matt Plank who's sero of Rippling did one with Sam Blonde who was then CRO of Brex. It's called Rippling Secrets to Hypergrowth. It sounds like a commercial for Rippling, which is okay, right? But because Sam was, they worked together and now Sam's on the board and all, they have a fluency of two CROs who are honest and have a Lenny style learner's mindset. This one on the revenue playbook from Rippling, it's a 14 for GTM.
(中文): 这挺有意思的。就像B2B领域的许多情况一样，十年间一切几乎都维持原状，然后突然间所有东西都显得过时了，对吧？如果你想看一期稍早的节目——不算太久远，但在互联网AI时代背景下已算"陈旧"，我认为它会改变你的思维方式。可以看看我在Mailchimp被收购后与本·切斯特纳特对谈的那期。因为那是个充满魔力的时刻，标题叫《通往十亿之路上的所有坎坷》。那期只有2.3万次观看，对莱尼的频道来说不算什么，但对我来说已经很不错了。那是在他刚出售价值十亿美元公司后的珍贵时刻，他谈到交易如何险些破裂，挑战了我们熟知的几乎所有B2B指标——在那个规模下运营盈利企业时，并不太关注客户终身价值与获客成本这类指标，真正重要的是客户需求。如今的Mailchimp还像当年那样处于前沿吗？或许不是了。但我之所以推荐这期，是因为当下一切都趋于同质化，我们很少受到那种思维冲击，现在人们大多在为自己立场发声。你特别擅长引导人们跳出固有立场，而我认为这期节目正是绝佳范例。

如果观众想了解市场进入策略的内容，我们最近做了期很受欢迎的节目。因为嘉宾曾是我的团队成员——Rippling的销售负责人马特·普兰克，与当时担任Brex首席营收官的萨姆·布隆德对谈。节目叫《Rippling超高速增长的秘密》，听起来像Rippling的广告对吧？这没关系。由于萨姆曾与马特共事，现在又是董事会成员，两位坦诚的首席营收官以莱尼式的学习者心态流畅交流。这期关于Rippling营收策略的节目，在市场进入策略方面可以打14分（满分10分）。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: I just had Matt MacInnis on the podcast, former COO, now CPO At Rippling. So, that would be a good combo of those two. Jason, I don't know if you know this, but you're the perfect podcast guest because you have such deep experience in the space that you just have answers to everything I ask. Plus, you're now just living in this future that we're all heading towards and you're like hands-on telling us, here's how the future will be and here's how it works and here's how you can get there and here's what you shouldn't do and here's what we'll bring. So, I'm just so thankful that you're here sharing all this advice with us. I'm excited for many more podcast conversations. So, thanks for doing this.
(中文): 我刚刚在播客中采访了Matt MacInnis，他之前是首席运营官，现在是Rippling的首席产品官。所以，那会是这两者的绝佳组合。Jason，我不知道你是否了解这一点，但你是完美的播客嘉宾，因为你在这一领域有着深厚的经验，对我提出的每个问题都有答案。而且，你现在就生活在我们所有人都将前往的那个未来之中，你就像是亲身实践地告诉我们：未来会是怎样的，它是如何运作的，你如何能够到达那里，你不应该做什么，以及我们将带来什么。所以，我非常感谢你在这里与我们分享所有这些建议。我期待未来能有更多的播客对话。所以，感谢你参与这次访谈。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: All right, Lenny, you're the best. I'm just a super fan. I'm lucky to be here. So, thank you.
(中文): 好的，莱尼，你是最棒的。我只是个超级粉丝。能在这里真是我的荣幸。所以，谢谢你。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Let me just ask you, how can listeners be useful to you as a closing question?
(中文): 让我问你，听众如何能对你有用，作为结束问题？

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: The fun thing for me, we have two websites, SaaStr.com and SaaStr.ai. Just go to Saster.ai and just play with the tools we built. Play with the valuation calculator we talked about. Play with the AI VC, play with any of our tools and just have fun and share any feedback because I've waited 10 years to build tools for the SaaStr community. Now I want to build like 20. So, on the side, we've talked about tools you should go buy, but building your own stuff's pretty fun too. So, try our tools and give me kind, but critical feedback, but with some kindness.
(中文): 对我来说有趣的是，我们有两个网站：SaaStr.com 和 SaaStr.ai。直接访问SaaStr.ai，尽情体验我们打造的工具吧。试试我们讨论过的估值计算器，玩玩AI VC，体验我们所有的工具，享受乐趣并分享任何反馈——因为我等待了十年才为SaaStr社区构建这些工具。现在我想再打造大约20个。所以，虽然我们之前聊过你应该购买哪些工具，但自己动手构建也相当有趣。因此，请尝试我们的工具，并给我一些既善意又带批判性的反馈，但请保持些许温和。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Okay. And that's S-A-A-S-T-R.ai?
(中文): 好的。那么是 S-A-A-S-T-R.ai 吗？

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: .ai. Yeah, I'm still trying to figure out the AI versus the com. We got an SEO issue, so I can't really move it over, but...
(中文): 人工智能。是的，我还在琢磨人工智能与com的区别。我们遇到了搜索引擎优化问题，所以暂时没法迁移过来，不过……

[Lenny Rachitsky]: It looks great. It works, it works. It's shorter too.
(中文): 看起来很棒。它有效，确实有效。而且也更短了。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: It is shorter.
(中文): 它更短。

[Lenny Rachitsky]: Jason, thank you so much for being here.
(中文): 杰森，非常感谢你能来。

[Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)]: All right, Lenny, you're the best.
(中文): 好的，莱尼，你是最棒的。
